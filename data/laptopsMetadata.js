If you dont mind plunking down the extra $100 for the touchscreen then go for it but really you will do fine without it and save yourself $100 especially if you are buying these as gifts like I did for others in my family.Here is a list of the APPS I use on both and it runs them fast and flawlessly:Facebook, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Chrome Remote Desktop (flawlessly connects to my Windows 7 laptop and I can run any windows program remotely with ease and flawlessly connects to my Office Desktop and I can access all my office records which is key since i am a family doc), Google Cloud Print (easily prints documents to all the printers i have set up), MyBible, Kindle, Twitter, Hootsuite, Weatherbug, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube, Google+ photos (automatically puts all my photos taken on my Iphone over to my chromebook), RUNS ALL WEBSITES INCLUDING BANKING WEBSITES and my mobile hospital app FLAWLESSLY WITH CHROME (including adobe flash player sites which my Ipad and Iphone still wont run)The only CONS i can find so far are no SKYPE app.....If you want to do video calls then need to use GOOGLE HANGOUTS which is much less intuitive than skype....and you CANNOT hook a printer directly to a chromebook but you can use google cloud print to print easily...needs wifi connection to do most things (this is really not a problem for me as i am always connected and they have developed a number of apps that work when not connected including document writer and email offline)Battery Life Amazing! almost 8hrs of use!Touchscreen good but not like an Ipad (can't use your fingers to zoom in with pinch)Touchpad very good!Keyboard very solid,Can use any wireless mouse with it.

Initially it meant to serve me as a second laptop for occasional light work online, but very soon I realized that I was using it most of the time. My powerful Windows laptop and Mac mini were just sitting there collecting dust, getting my attention only once a week at best. I replaced my Samsung with Acer C720 2 GB RAM version two weeks ago.Here's a quick breakdown.- C720 got a slightly better screen than Samsung. Same washed out colors, but contrast and viewing angles are better, and so is brightness level. If you are spoiled by the screens of modern tablets, you might think that 1366x768 resolution would look unattractive. That's not quite right. I should remind you that MacBook's Air 11 screen has the same resolution and the same size. It's just enough to do what it's designed to do.- The keyboard layout of C720 may not be as good as Samsung's, but I like Acer's feel and key movement better. Unless you have very large hands, it might provide one of the best typing experiences in the price range below $300, and it's definitely better than most Windows laptops for that price. I write quite a lot and C720's keyboard didn't cause any significant discomfort so far. Touchpad is reasonably good, but nothing to be overexcited about. I only wish it was a bit larger.- C720 is WAY faster than Samsung. Don't be deceived by the name of the processor - this Celeron unit from the Haswell family has more processing power than Chrome OS requires. And 2 GB of RAM should be absolutely enough for anyone, who normally doesn't keep over a dozen tabs running heavy websites simultaneously. The fan would kick in from time to time, but it's very quiet and is never annoying.- Battery life is one of the sweetest spots of this laptop. To get promised 8.5 hours you don't have to keep the screen brightness at 50% all the time (as you would do with the Samsung to get 6.5 hours). I don't carry the charger with me and never managed to make it run out of juice. In fact, sometimes I would even give some boost to my phone's battery from C720 without worrying that it may die unexpectedly. Also, the battery charges pretty quickly.- Speakers of C720 are louder than Samsung's, but they don't sound much better - they shoot down at the table (or your lap) and don't really promise anything. But plug in headphones or external speakers and you'll get some decent sound quality for a low budget device.- The Web Camera on C720 is also superior to the one in Samsung. Promised difference in resolution might not be that visible, but it keeps higher framerate, works better in low light and seems like it captures a wider viewing angle. It is definitely an upgrade. Microphone gets the job done, but it's not very useful in somewhat noisy conditions.- C720 is a little bit heavier than Samsung, but by no means it is heavy or bulky. It is still a portable laptop that could be easily moved or carried with one hand. Its build quality is better than most Windows laptops below $350. Obviously, there's nothing special about the quality of materials, but everything feels solid, the lid mechanism is sturdy enough, and overall it's not bad at all. It certainly lacks some style, but it looks and feels more expensive than it costs.I love Chromebooks for the ease of use. The first set up takes about five minutes. They are perfect for kids, for elderly people unfamiliar with computers, for students, for writers, bloggers or even programmers. It's amazing how much stuff can be done in a browser. Online shopping, social networking, managing emails, listening to music, watching movies, reading books, video chatting - everything that most casual users actually do on their computers and even more. Offline capabilities are not forgotten - you can watch movies from the local or external storage, listen to music, work with Google Docs and many other Chrome apps or even games that can run offline. One the greatest things about Chrome OS - there is virtually no maintenance. You have to try really hard to make it work wrong. Updates are seamless and a complete reset of the system with the Powerwash, in case you want to give it away or sell it, takes just few minutes.I was skeptical when the idea of a Chromebook was introduced to the public. But when I tried one myself and gave it a proper open-minded shot, I wasn't able to go back. Today Acer C720 is my daily driver and I would change it only to a better Chromebook. For $199 it's almost impossible to beat its value. Don't forget, that with the purchase you also get 100 GB of Google Drive space for 2 years. And if you like touchscreens, C720p for $299 is also a very good deal.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"I'm a technology addict and I've been following the development of ChromeOS for a while. When it first came out, I totally understood the concept but wanted to wait for it to mature a while and the prices to come down. My trigger price point was $200 so when the 2GB version of C720 came out, I had to have one.I find it amazing that such an inexpensive device can do so much. After having it a week, it became my favorite machine just because it is so simple and light. After using it, you come to question why we need such big computing power, huge hard discs and RAM just to run a traditional OS when it comes to supporting the use cases for about 90% of what you use a PC to do. Whats even better, the Chromebook is pretty much ready to go out of the box, with an already pretty rich supply of online an offline apps don't cost you anything extra.Just like tablets came on the market and turned the PC industry upside down because they did 80% of a PC did, and did it with a better user experience, lower price with much less hardware spec. In the same way, I think the Chromebook will have a permanent place in personal tech as the one matching basic needs at the cheapest price - a second PC for around the home, or the \"throwaway\" unit for travel where you don't have to worry about damaging or losing it because its both cheap and highly secure.Specific to the C720 - I agree with most that the screen could be much better but it is still quite acceptable considering the price. The trackpad and the keyboard as well - I have no trouble using them and the trackpad is actually better than many more expensive PCs. I think the build quality is actually quite good - it looks professional and robust enough so that it can survive a road warrior's abuse.The 2GB ram is also the best value in my opinion. I've read a comparison report that showed that the 4GB really has no advantage until you open up 15-20 tabs at once, anything less than that the performance is identical. My own experience (I usually open up only 5 to 10 tabs at once) is that browsing performance is excellent - comparable to my 2013 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM that cost 5x the price.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"}],"detailed_specifications":[{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Technical Details","specifications":[{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Size","description":"11.6 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Resolution","description":"1366x768"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Max Screen Resolution","description":"720 pixels"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor","description":"1.4 GHz Intel Celeron"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"RAM","description":"2 GB DDR3L SDRAM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Memory Speed","description":"1333.00"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive","description":"16 GB SSD"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Graphics Coprocessor","description":"Intel HD Graphics"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Chipset Brand","description":"Intel"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Graphics Card Ram Size","description":"128 MB"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Wireless Type","description":"802.11abg"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Number of USB 2.0 Ports","description":"1"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Number of USB 3.0 Ports","description":"1"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Brand Name","description":"Acer"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Series","description":"Acer C720-2848 11.6-Inch Chromebook (Granite Gray)"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item model number","description":"C720-2848"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hardware Platform","description":"PC"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Operating System","description":"Chrome"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Weight","description":"2.8 pounds"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Dimensions  L x W x H","description":"11.34 x 8.03 x 0.75 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Color","description":"Granite Gray"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Brand","description":"Intel"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Count","description":"2"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Computer Memory Type","description":"DDR3 SDRAM, SODIMM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Flash Memory Size","description":"16"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive Interface","description":"Serial ATA"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Audio-out Ports (#)","description":"1"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Batteries:","description":"1 Lithium ion batteries required.

I need something to carry around that I won't worry about losing, breaking, or someone stealing. I won't bring my Apple laptop to school due to theft increases lately. On that note, I wanted something for web browsing, typing papers in the library egg chairs and had a keyboard\/trackpad combo. I found it.This is not for a poweruser. Don't fool yourselves, people. It's a tablet on steroids. Get that through your head when you purchase and use it. If you have any other expectations like some of the reviewers, well, you're honestly not the target audience. It's meant to be light and cost affordable. Sure, the screen isn't high resolution and it lacks expandable RAM and HD space. That's NOT what this computer is.I've had the computer for a few days now and I love it. It's not super fast by any means; however, it gets the job done in regards to web browsing, finding papers for literature reviews and listening to rdio or Pandora. That's what I need this for. And most likely the average consumer. Face it, most college students buy $1000 Macbooks to look cool. For what? To facebook, stream music, and browse the web. Most people who do photo editing buy the 15\" models with maxed out specs (like me). I don't want to bring that to campus. That's too much money to be slinging in my bag to just browse the web.So, let me be clear. This laptop is excellent. The build quality is amazing for the price. Build quality is great of which I was surprised. The keyboard reminds me of the Macbook and the track-pad keeps up with my fast paced motions quite well. It's light and I can have four to five tabs open running different processes at ease. It does like to stutter when I do multiple things with a video running though. Expected for a tablet processor though.I will admit, this little computer will replace your daily use computer you lug around currently. I used the Chrome Remote Desktop today on campus and was amazed at the speed and ease. I was using my Macbook at home on campus without any hiccups like I experience with Logmein or those other clients. Accessing the 100GB of free storage was as simple as clicking a link. My music, documents and life are on the cloud. I can access them with ease. Printing is no problem for me, either.This little beast will surprise you. Although, please, don't expect the world from this laptop. It's $250, folks.P.S. I typed this from the Chromebook. No problems handling my typing speed. And ask questions if you need them answered.UPDATE 11\/24:I've been using this for a good while now and I haven't had any regrets. The computer does what I need, when I want and I only miss running Netflix at school. That's ok though, I have other avenues for watching movies. They do plan on updating and that's a problem with Netflix, not Google. Printing is simple as it seems to be a very common question. To clicks on your computer and you're done. They have been updating the OS and the Chromebook is acting a little better now. Overall, I'm still loving it. Just remember, it's NOT for everyone.UPDATE 02\/06\/13:I love this computer. It is all I use around campus and for class lectures. I barely use Microsoft Office for my notes or spreadsheets in class. Google Drive and their office version is just awesome. If you do a lot of team-based activities, please, just use Google Drive. Keep your documents available to you at all times and collaboration is simple. It has made my life much easier. Just thought I'd let you all know.UPDATE 04\/11\/13:Netflix now works!UPDATE 07\/10\/13:Now that the school season is upon us, I thought I would go ahead and write an update of my handy-dandy little Chromebook. Let's just say, it's still alive and working. Drops, falls, and tosses across the couch and slides across the table this little tabcom is doing well. Software wise, Google has been working at it and getting all the bugs out of the system to provide an even more fluid experience. I love having the ability to use Google Print from ANYWHERE I am and have it waiting for me when I need it. Everything syncs up across platforms and this has really come in hand during projects. Just try the Google Docs as a team compared to Word with Review and you won't go back when doing initial collaboration. Battery is still holding up to 8-10 hours (I know, right)- that's with smart use of the brightness. I honestly don't know what else to say. It works and is the perfect complement for my Macbook that is collecting dust at home. The Macbook is used via my Google Remote Connection and it's just wonderful. No lag or anything like I've had with LogMeIn and the other one. And like always, ask questions if you have them. And I almost forgot to add that Spotify works in the browser just as well as the PC version. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon streaming does work contrary to the other review posted saying the opposite. Cheers!FINAL UPDATE:The Chromebook is an excellent computer for those looking for something light. It won't do everything a full laptop will do and there are privacy concerns of the all-mighty Google. The question to ask yourself though is if you are really secure online? You can get a better laptop as some commentators have stated and that is very true. You can get a nice, heavy computer to carry around and worry about. This Chromebook offers you peace of mind that you can throw it around and not worry about it being stolen (as long as you have a good password on your Google account). It works for me and I'm sure it works for the MAJORITY of others. I've had it for nearly a year and it is only getting faster, not slower. I hope you will take the time to see if it works for you. If not, we live in a world full of other gadgets and tools to fit our lives. I will be removing myself from the comments as there has been a strong output of support from other owners. Live long and prosper!\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"First off, I am an admitted IT Geek.  I have a computer science degree and have spent my entire career working in IT on everything from mainframes to wearable computers.  I really know computers inside and out.  I want to provide some perspective about the Chromebook by a person who spends 10-12 hours on some type of computing device every day.So why would I ever buy a device like this?  Well, I ordered the Chromebook to evaluate it for my parents.  They are not tech savvy at all.  They have a Kindle Fire and an iPad, but when they do write e-mails and want to do other tasks, the pads are just not enough.  They are computer users and media consumption people.  What I found out during my work with the Chromebook is that it is the right computer for me too.  Now, off to the review...First off the Google Chromebook is computer unlike anything coming from the minds of Apple or Microsoft.  Something on the surface that an IT Geek like me probably wouldn't like.  It doesn't have a full-blown operating system like OSX nor is it a mobile platform like Android.  It is something in between, it is ChromeOS.  It is very fast, very reliable, and is perfect for doing your  everyday tasks.  If you mostly read e-mail, write notes, run spreadsheets, develop presentations, chat, Facebook, and surf, you should read on.The Samsung Chromebook is very sleek, thin, and light.  It is somewhat similar in form to a Macbook Air, but it's also close to a number of the new Ultrabooks.  The feel in hand is very solid and doesn't seem like a $249 computer.  The keyboard is very good; very solid feel and great action.  If you type quickly (100+ wpm), you'll be happy to know this keyboard can keep up with you.When you open the box and lift the lid it automatically starts up in under 10 seconds.  This is not coming up from sleep mode.  That's its boot time from a cold start.  The setup process is as painless as it can be.  Attach it to your wireless network and if you have a gmail account, just login and you are done.  I up and reading e-mail in my account in less than 5 minutes.  The last out of the box Windows experience took nearly an hour before I was through all of the setup questions, patches, and add-ons.Now that you are logged in, the simplicity of the system reveals itself.  Effectively the entire Chromebook is a dedicated Chrome browser.  Almost everything you do is in a Chrome browser window.  There are applications included and that can be installed, but they all run inside of the Chrome framework.  It is a new way to think about computing.  And boy is it fast.About the speed: Wow is the best way to describe it.  I dare you to find a browser that is as responsive as the Chrome broswer on ChromeOS.  All running on a tiny little ARM processor.  This tiny little ARM processor is what gives the Chromebook its 7+ hour run time on a single charge.  In practice a lot of this depends on what you are doing.  If you want to stream 7 hours of YouTube videos, you're probably going to be disappointed, but for practical all-day off the charger use, I'm seeing that performance easily.  It also charges like lightening, so if you throw it on the charger for an hour at lunch, you won't need to worry about it into the evening.Back to why I am keeping the Samsung Chromebook.  The device does what I need to do 95% of the time during my work day and 99% for the rest of my life.  All of this in a very sleek, inexpensive, and portable package.  I still have my work computer, a Lenovo i7 based monster, but it is huge, heavy, and doesn't have nearly the battery life or portability of the Chromebook.  I now leave that laptop in the docking station on my desk and carry around the Chromebook and that is the computer I take home.  I suppose if I was still spending the majority of my time writing C# I would need a different tool, but the Chromebook is the right tool for me.Pros and Cons?This introduces an interesting point of view.  What can we really compare the Chromebook to?  There is nothing else that is in it's class, so I guess I'll focus primarily on functionality.Pros:-Inexpensive (I didn't say cheap)-Light-Fast-All Google-Centric  (this can also be a Con)-Very simple to setup and use-Long battery life-Good build quality-Good keyboard-Good library of add-on applications (yes, another app store)-Everything for one price (Hardware, Operating System, Storage, Office Applications)Cons:-Not a full-blown operating system-Doesn't run Mac, iOS, Windows, or Android applications...none of them, it can't-All Google-Centric (this can also be a Pro)-Some apps you know and love aren't available yet, maybe never (Netflix is one)-Not as mainstream as either full-blown computer platforms or mobile platformsI gave the Samsung Chromebook 4 stars because it's really good, but not perfect.  Bottom line, this is a new device that lives somewhere between tablets and full-blown traditional computers.  It is a great consumption device with a full keyboard for doing some serious work (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, e-mail, and web-based applications).  I recommend that you give it a shot, I think you'll really like it.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"***Updates To My Review At The End***My background: I'm a gadget geek but I'm not super devoted to any platform. I do love Google's web products but never used their hardware. My laptop is a 13\" MacBook Pro and my desktop is a Mac Mini that runs both OS X and Windows 7 (I spend more time on Win 7 these days). I have an iPad (3rd gen) and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx along with a docking station. My wife has a Win 7 ultrabook, Kindle Fire HD and Razr Maxx, all of which I purchased for her.I'm an editor for a web-based publication so my usage is primarily writing and some light (very light) image editing. I've done most of my writing on Google Docs for a long time because it automatically saves and I hate writing directly into the CMS. We also use Google Apps Business for e-mail, calendaring and doc sharing so that rocks.The last thing I need is another computer but Chromebook called to me. A couple of reasons:- The docking solution wasn't great. The keyboard was crap, my phone got unusually hot and interacting with the CMS was hit and miss with the phone OS. It was good for e-mails.- An iPad with a keyboard is garbage. I've tried it and hit the same issues. It is just clumsy for my primary work. I still travel with an iPad because it is light and its battery is a rockstar and can do in a pinch.- The laptop is fine but it is a beast to carry. I just got back from a week-long jaunt to three conferences and I think my shoulder is broken from my shoulder bag.- I love my phone and tethering has been a lifesaver. No complaints.Okay, enough background. Now to the actual review.Unboxing wasn't particularly impressive but I don't really care. Standard laptop box with the laptop, an AC adapter and Chrome sticker.When I pulled it out of the box, it almost felt like a laptop that didn't have a battery in it (remember that?). Anyway, it feels solid closed up. I don't have any problem throwing this in my engineer's bag and feeling like it will get screwed up. The AC adapter is your standard black box with two cords.I opened up the lid and it started immediately. It asked me to connect to my wifi connection and then proceeded to download the latest update of the operating system (version 23 according to the info in Chrome). After a quick reboot, I put in my Google credentials and it loaded everything I use in my Chrome browser normally, including my apps and bookmarks.Opened up, the build quality showed a few weaknesses but nothing major. There's a little give on the keyboard and palm rest. I didn't feel any problems holding the laptop from its corner. It feels very solid overall. The thing to remember, of course, is that I came from a unibody MacBook Pro so take that for what it is worth.The keyboard blew my expectations away. I figured it would be fairly cramped and that my typing speed would suffer. I figured the action wouldn't be very good either. But, coming from a MacBook Pro chiclet keyboard to this was a cinch. I feel very little difference in typing speed or accuracy. This was really a big deal for me. I tried the HP Mini a few years ago and it was awful. A few millimeter difference is it.The trackpad is very good though not as top notch of a comparison as the keyboard. It is very Mac-like in using it. The two finger swipe gestures, right-clicking, dragging, etc... it all operated like I expected. I'm a tapper, not a clicker so that may have something to do with it. It doesn't seem like it is quite as accurate or response as the MacBook Pro but still very good.The screen isn't great but it isn't a dealbreaker. For text, it performs adequately but not spectacularly. For video, it is quite adequate, maybe above average but again, not fantastic. The screen brightness isn't what it could be, I feel like it is a tick or two off what should be standard brightness. But, I am also used to glossy screens and even with the brightness, the matte screen seems to do okay. I work right next to south-facing windows and even though we have no sun here in Seattle, it gets fairly bright and it seems good in these conditions. The viewing angles aren't going to impress anyone but it works for me.The speakers seem to be pretty good and loud enough. They are optimal for use on a desk rather than a lap though as the sound gets muffled a bit by clothing. I put on Pandora One and the sound through my nice $100 studio headphones sounds pretty good with the top volume topping out just right. Using my Apple headphone\/mic combo, it worked well in a hangout. One thing is that the headphone jack seems very tight.I hit my first snag when I tried to do HDMI out. It didn't seem to work. Then I read a bit more and got it to work with the Ctrl+Full Screen and that seemed to do it. Depending on your monitor, your results may vary. It actually looked great on my LCD TV (including sound) but the resolution needs to be adjusted. It didn't look good (ironically) on my Samsung 21 inch monitor. There might be some settings I'm missing on either side but it's not a huge deal. Testing the video on the 1920x1080 HDTV, it worked great other than the overscanning.The camera is something that Monet would appreciate. You'll get the gist of it but this is no HD cam. It is good for basic pictures and compares unfavorably to the front-facing camera on my Droid Razr Maxx.After an hour of use off the charger, the heat situation is non-existent. This thing is creepily quiet and cool to the touch except for a few warmer spots. I will end up watching a movie to see how it reacts but that would be a nice change. Even my iPad gets warmer.I had no opportunity to try out the bluetooth or the SD card reader. I will be getting a 32 GB SD card. I did try out a USB drive and it seems to be working just fine.Getting into the software and how it drives on the ARM processor, I was pretty impressed. I opened about 18 tabs (which is well beyond my max, typically) and I had Pandora running in the background the entire time and didn't get a stutter. At times, the load was sluggish but again, I am switching between this and a MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a dual-core i5. But I really expected this to be flawless when using the web. As long as you don't go crazy with tabs or the apps you are driving in them, you should be good.Watching videos, outside of the screen quality, was really quite smooth. From someone who bought the original Kindle Fire and saw it stumble with streaming video for just $50 less, I was super-impressed. I don't know if power-users will love it but it works with my slightly-lowered expectations.That being said, this is a web enabled device and there are a few (very few) apps that I use regularly.My stand-alone apps that I use regularly is chat (Google and AIM) and Tweetdeck. Both Tweetdeck and imo seem to work pretty good in a browser. If anyone has any suggestions, let me know.I also know that Skype doesn't work great right now. I am using it through imo but, at least as far as I can tell, I can't make dial-out calls like the Skype app allows on all of my other devices. This, including no support for a USB headset, would make it tough to make this a full-time replacement. I live on Skype as a dial-out provider (Google dial-out will not allow me to use certain conference call providers plus Skype is great for connecting with people worldwide with ease). I'm hoping a promised webapp version is coming soon. On the plus side, Skype works great on my cell and iPad.I turned off the wifi connection and it worked liked it should. You need to turn on offline mode in Gmail and Google Drive in order for it to work but after that, it worked like it always has. Games that I had loaded for offline mode worked. Offline, this is a pretty limited machine but not unduly so.Chrome remote desktop worked particularly well. Granted, I was using it on the same network but there was no lag on the software side of using it. I was, again, thoroughly impressed with the graphics. Though, one thing would be to allow me to select which screen I view when I am using a dual-display.I'm looking forward to Netflix capability but that's not ultra-critical right now for me. Amazon Instant works well for me, as does Hulu.I'm taking only this when I go on an extended trip this weekend so I can update more on real battery life and any other real-world experiences of using it later.Overall, this is what I expected and I am pretty happy with the purchase, especially as one of my first sight-unseen types of purchase. For my uses as a primary road writing device for blog posts and e-mails, this is a solid, solid play. And for $250, it's pretty unbelievable. All of this typed into the new Chromebook as well at my normal rate.== UPDATE 10\/28\/2012 ==Just took this thing on a weekend away without bringing my laptop. This is a big deal as even if I took my iPad, I would normally take my laptop as well. A couple of additional thoughts from 72 hours as my primary computer.I did end up getting a SD Card (a 32 GB one from Amazon) and putting it in the SD card slot. Unfortunately, it sticks out from the side pretty well (about a centimeter looking straight down on it). I loaded it with a few movies and some music so I would have some tunes and movies for offline. The player works fine but is very basic. Other than wishing the SD card would seat all the way in, it is a good setup for leisurely watching movies solo.I also did some extended work while my wife was driving. I typed two articles and I can't emphasize enough how good of quality this keyboard is. Even working it off of my lap, it performed beyond its price point.I typed those articles offline and using Google Docs offline worked as expected. When I reconnected, my documents synced up no problem. This worked exactly like it had on my MacBook Pro whenever I took it on a flight without wifi so no surprises there.Under normal use, the battery is probably going to be right there in the 6.5 hour range. Google could have pushed this spec. Working offline with the screen brightness at 50%, I was able to squeeze a little over 2 hours into 25% of battery life.Speaking of brightness, the ambient light sensor works pretty well. Maybe a little too good in the car as it would dim slightly as we went under overpasses on the freeway.The other thing I wanted to do is try out the some games. I played Angry Birds because I could compare it across all devices and the Chromebook is definitely lagging in performance. It was just a step behind and could be a bit choppy. I also tried the most popular game Entanglement and it seemed to perform well though it is simple. I also did a fantasy basketball draft on Yahoo sports and it was also a step behind.I'll also mention that the first time I loaded up Entanglement was the first time the Chromebook crashed on me. I don't imagine it will happen that often but the nice thing is that it recovered everything I had up in about 20 seconds. Also, it is the first time I noticed heat of any kind coming from the laptop at all. Not unusually hot but it will warm up some when going graphics and CPU intensive.In any case, I stand by my 4 star review. Even with some minor performance issues and a few smaller issues with quality, this is still an excellent purchase. An improved screen and battery life would make it easier to look past the sometimes-lagging performance. I won't be getting rid of my MacBook Pro but I am looking forward to taking this thing on the road and getting a good chunk of the functionality without the weight.== UPDATE 11\/20\/2012 ==After about a month more with regular usage, a couple more notes.After awhile, the Chromebook does warm up but not significantly. Again, I'm comparing this to other laptops. And really, you shouldn't be using a laptop on your lap anyway but some situations require it.Closing the screen instantly puts it to sleep but I definitely have found that you can't keep just putting this thing to sleep time after time and not expect any lag. Eventually, something I loaded would make the Chromebook freeze and I'd have to restart. I've learned to simply shut this computer down rather than close the lid and let it sleep. With near instant boot time, it's not a big deal but that's definitely a change.The keyboard on this thing is still a rockstar. Using it in poorly lit situations make me long for a bit of backlighting but I am really a touch typer at this point so it only slows me down when I am realigning my hands.No degradation in performance. I've watched probably 6-7 ripped movies on this thing with no problems and no internet connection. Looking forward to taking this to my in-laws for Thanksgiving instead of my MacBook Pro.== UPDATE 03\/09\/2013 ==I haven't updated in awhile so I thought I would. I still use the Chromebook on a regular basis and thanks to the regular updates to the system, this version of the Chromebook now has swap enabled (at least in the beta channel). For those unfamiliar, previously when the Chromebook would run out of physical RAM, it would just start dumping inactive tabs (so it would require a refresh). It would, at times, get a bit laggy with too many tabs open.With swap enabled, once you hit the top of your RAM usage, it starts using the hard drive as RAM. This means limited to no inactive tabs being dumped (I haven't seen one yet) and overall, faster usage under heavy workloads (10+ tabs).In short, this computer has actually gotten faster and better since my last update.A couple of issues still exist. Netflix still doesn't work. I've contacted Netflix and they say they are working on it. They've been saying the same for months though. Every other streaming service works (including Amazon Prime, Hulu and Comcast's streaming). If Netflix is a must and you don't have an alternative device (I use an iPad mini for it if I really need it), I wouldn't bet on this coming through anymore.I would like to see more gestures using the trackpad as well, The two finger scrolling is nice but the three finger nav (especially for back) helps a lot. I can use the keyboard back button too, yes. But switching between using a Mac and the Chromebook makes it especially unnatural. More gestures!There is a little bit of wear on the palm rests and some dings but nothing major as of yet. This thing still is great for writing (which is my primary use for it). It is so great and lightweight so it is easy to throw in a small bag for a day trip.Overall, still very happy and it is even better with the speed and stability improvements with swap enabled.== UPDATE 03\/11\/2013 ==Just a quick update since I just updated but Netflix now works. I've tried it and it has been confirmed by many other users. Again, this has been a big ding against both Netflix and Google for not figuring this out but now it is working.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"}],"detailed_specifications":[{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Technical Details","specifications":[{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Size","description":"11.6 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Resolution","description":"1366 x 768"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Max Screen Resolution","description":"1366 x 768 pixels"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor","description":"1.7 GHz Exynos 5000 Series"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"RAM","description":"2 GB DDR3L SDRAM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Memory Speed","description":"1333.00"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive","description":"16 GB eMMC"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Graphics Coprocessor","description":"Integrated Graphics"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Wireless Type","description":"802.11 a\/b\/g\/n"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Number of USB 2.0 Ports","description":"1"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Brand Name","description":"Samsung"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Series","description":"Chromebook"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item model number","description":"XE303C12-A01US"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Operating System","description":"Chrome"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Weight","description":"2.4 pounds"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Dimensions  L x W x H","description":"11.40 x 8.09 x 0.69 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Color","description":"Silver"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Brand","description":"Samsung"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Count","description":"2"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Computer Memory Type","description":"DDR3 SDRAM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Flash Memory Size","description":"16"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Optical Drive Type","description":"No"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Audio-out Ports (#)","description":"1"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Battery Type","description":"Lithium Polymer (LiPo)"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Batteries:","description":"1 Lithium ion batteries required.

I can't blame the tablet for that. Going against my better judgment, the little kid in me didn't want to wait for that, so I turned it on after only about a half-hour of charge. I will say that during initial Windows setup, it shut off due to a lack of charge.... My fault. The reason I'm including that is because it is a possible cause of how the device behaved initially. The device while plugged in, seemed to not be charging or doing so at a very poor pace, as others have mentioned. It was sluggish, webpages were loading very slowly in desktop mode and in the Modern IE app. The WiFi randomly cut out, and most of the modern apps (The Metro UI) would open for a second and then force close with no error message. I was aggravated and very close to returning it. However I had read many reviews that lead me to believe that this was not the case for some people.  I work in IT, and I'm not a person who can just give up on a device like this without troubleshooting first, regardless of how strong the urge may be. The first thing I tried was a very simple factory restore, not thinking it would do much but it was worth a shot as a starting point. To my surprise, it worked. The device was suddenly much more responsive, the apps were opening quickly and not force closing, the WiFi was working fine, and the battery was definitely charging whether the screen was on or off. Also to address another review, the charging LED by the power button DOES go from orange to white when it is fully charged. While it may not be the fastest charging device, it charged a lot faster than my 3rd Gen iPad.Now to actually discuss a few things about the physical device. The Screen is nice, not as bright or pixel dense as my iPad was but the extra functionality I receive with Windows 8 is well worth the trade-off. Besides, I didn't really notice a huge difference when watching Netflix or Hulu. The difference was only noticeable with text, but either way it is still a nice and perfectly adequate screen with nice viewing angles and pretty decent color.As for build quality, I don't know what people are complaining about. I was expecting to pick this up and have it feel really cheap and light, and not a good kind of lightweight. This thing isn't too heavy but has a nice solid weight to it as well as the keyboard dock. I'm not saying it felt as \\\"premium\\\" as the iPad did, but it is perfectly fine to me and not just because of the price. The touchpad on the dock is a little erratic at times and doesn't feel great, but it works fine for me. The keyboard is a little small as well, but I'd still prefer it over always using the on-screen keyboard. I applaud Asus for including the dock at this price because to be honest using Desktop mode in Windows 8 sometimes requires a mouse or trackpad to avoid a lot of frustration from mis-taps.Overall, I'm glad I purchased this device. Anything intensive I can do on my desktop, though this little guy seems to be pretty capable. Obviously this won't replace your main computer unless you really only use it for web browsing, watching videos, and creating\/editing documents (Comes with Office Home and Student for free..or at least bundled into the great price.) But it is great for what I do with a tablet and a little more. So if you order this and have issues with it, give it a chance and at least attempt a factory restore, which is very simple to do.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"This has got to be one of the best tech values besides the Nexus 5 and Nokia 520. Fro $350-400, you get a FULL FEATURED 10 inch Windows 8 tablet that comes with a keyboard dock! Tablet one second, netbook the other! Its a fantastic device that gets 5 stars for its superb value alone!+ Great screen! People online may gripe on the 720p display, but you'll never notice using it+ Battery life: Took it off the charger 7am this morning, and been using it straight since browsing the internet, viewing several Youtube videos both on Flash and Metrotube app, reading PDFs with Bluetooth and Webcam on. Now at 4pm, and still have 40% on the tank! Definetly liberating from netbooks where under clocking underpowered devices was a necessity to get that battery life. About as good as my iPad.+The Speakers! As an iPad owner, I'm impressed. Very clear and very loud. definitely betrays their size. I've never had reason to crank it up past 50% so far.+ FULL WINDOWS 8.1! This can't be said enough. I think almost everyone who has bought a Netbook did so to get a full Windows experience in a relatively portable format, where I do not feel afraid to use the device on a subway, and doesn't require me to bring a charger.+ This things a BEAST for its size. Wana watch a flash Youtube video while browsing the net on the same screen? No problem! Wana do some photo editing while watching said video? No sweat! Everything is buttery smooth on Bay Trail. Hell, it seems faster than my Core2Duo 2009 White Macbook that I've been using as my primary computer (very happily especially with Mavericks) for 4 years now.+ FREE DOCK!!!!+ MicroSD card slot: Format it so NTFS, and you have an additional 32-64GB Hard Drive, so space no longer becomes a big issue.However.......- The Dock: I REALLY want to like this thing. Truly. But its pretty terrible. The keyboard has the same configuration and size as my 1000HE, which I've been using regularly until recently (broken fan). But its for some reason a pain in the ___ to type on. I think its because the keys are recessed in to the case too far, and the boarders around the keyboard are too high. Makes it very awkward to type on. Keys are also a bit stiff, but I personally don't mind that too much. Also, like others are reporting, there's still Q\/A issues with these: Bought it from BestBuy yesterday (32GB) so its a brand new batch. The space bar is already squeaking after just a days use. Now very difficult to type on. Gonna send it in for return.The Touchpad is also pretty bad. However, there's a way to make it pretty decent:1- realize that Asus put some stupid power saving feature to turn off the touchpad after 10 seconds or so. When you wana use it, just tap on it and use it. Small 6\/10 second thing, but it makes it much more bearable.2- On the Desktop, double click \\\"Asus Smart Gesture\\\" on the bottom right where the Dock is (where you see your Battery indicator). Go to \\\"Edge Gesture\\\" and TURN THAT SHAITE OFF!!! Whoever thought that was a good idea in the first place should be fired! This thing already has the ability to do gestures with the touch screen. What's the point in adding all these unusable gestures to such a small touchpad? Leave it alone! The only gesture it needs is 2 finger scrolling. The rest is pointless.3- After that, go to Mouse Settings on the Control Panel and crank up both touch sensitivity and scrolling speed.So in conclusion, if you want a FULL 10 inch Windows Tablet that has a dock to use as a stand, case, and occasional keyboard, then get the Asus T100 without hesitation. Its perfect.If, like me, you are looking to get one as a netbook replacement, then wait a bit longer. Either until Asus fixes their Q\/A issues, for competitor models that WILL be coming, or ditch the Tablet part and wait for the eventual touch screen Bay Trail netbooks.In my 1 day use, the tablet part adds to the Netbook experience. Complementing it with the fast processing and amazing battery life, this machine should be the Ultimate Computational Device.However, it isn't right now. My thumb is tired from hitting this squeaky space bar, so signing off!Edit: Just got back from Bestbuy to exchange the keyboard, and the overall response is much better. Think the keyboard was defective all around. If it holds up after the next few weeks, I'll bump it up to 4 stars. Still, be wary of the quality control issues on this product, and make sure you buy it from somewhere that has a very flexible return policy.Edit 2: Well, it's been a month and so far, so good! The new dock has shown no wear and is now holding up well. after about a month, it's staring to replace my iPad as a tablet. Not entirely, but it's getting there. 4:3 aspect ratio is still ideal for tablet browsing, and Windows store is sorely lacking apps...but considering that I never intended this little thing to replace my MacBook OR iPad, I gotta say Tablet internet Explorer has grown on me! And I haven't really touched my MacBook since getting this, as I am able to do all my editing fine with the T100.Another thing to be wary of: The plastics in the tablet are cheap. No joke. I put it in my book bag with the dock snug in a relatively safe compartment. Never banged it, or dropped it, etc. took it out, and found a very small crack on the side of the tablet. It's very small and everything works perfect, but considering the amount of drops and damage I've done with my old Asus Netbook, it's a bit disappointing it's that brittle. When in use, get a case for the whole thing. AmazonBasics has a cheap $9 case for 10 inch tablets that fits well and gives good enough protection.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"I've been using this unique machine for about five hours now (update below). Before I review it, I want to give some context: I regularly use the Nexus 10 for mobile computing with a keyboard - arguably the best screen you can buy on a tablet.  I also have the first Nexus 7.  I have tried to present on my Nexus 10 and it crashed the projector.  So I have been using my Asus 1201n running Win8.1 to handle all MS programs.Enter the Asus T100.  I didn't buy it for the tablet option, though that is useful.  I bought it for a few reasons - 10 hrs of Microsoft usage without plugging in.  Good touchscreen.  Light - very important - it must fit in my small shoulder bag with my Nexus 10 and a book without strain. Fast processor - at least four times faster than the Atom dual core in my Asus 1201n, which really was cutting edge in Sept. 2010 (still pretty solid).My initial verdict.Screen - you won't be upset.  Any rendering problems are Microsoft's and not due to the pixel count. If the pixel count was higher on this size screen MS rendering would make everything really small (Android is much better with this 10\" form). Asus's reading mode turns the screen a yellow hue, but may help the eyes. Touch functionality is exceptional - though reviewers say it only has 5 pt touch, not 10 (which used to be standard - not sure why this has been reduced - though I never use 10 fingers on the screen at once). Track pad is also quite good, though I'm not a clicker - I like to double tap - which this does well.Charging - slowKeyboard - cramped compared to my 12 inch netbook.  Cramped compared to my Bluetooth Motorola android keyboard (which is superb). But in five hours I feel like I'm already about 50% adapted to the key layout.  Way better than typing on the screen.Processor and performance - Snappy.  This is not an i5 chip, for sure.  But you won't wait for anything to load when launching apps. This is my fastest machine - it feels like a work horse to me, but I don't do video editing and I don't play pc games.  I do regularly use ppt, vlc, youtube ripper, lots of chrome.  Let's say I'm an aggressive word processor, browser, ppt user.  This is ideal for me, though I could enjoy a 12 inch screen.  The biggest issue that makes the screen feel cramped is simply the small Win8 text rendering - which can be adjusted.My advice - I'd buy this over a Chromebook .  I'd buy this over the high priced but attractive looking Yoga and any other Win8 running Mac Book Air competitor (definitely buy it over a surface - you'd have to be crazy to pull the trigger on a surface pro over this baby). The 2gb of ram is much speedier on this machine than the 4gb ram in my Asus 1201n (that I upgraded).  I haven't had a ram issue yet and I'm running lots of programs and apps simultaneously.For what it is worth, I agree with most everything said in this review: http:\/\/techreport.com\/review\/25537\/asus-transformer-book-t100-convertible-notebook-reviewedEnjoy!Update after a few days of use:The battery is exceptional. On a typical day I use the computer about 7 hours and I regularly have 30% left by the time I close the lid (brightness is set to auto adjust).  It also accepts a charge from my external battery pushing my mobile work time up to double the reported 10 hrs.I'm adjusting to the keyboard, but like many reviewers have noted, the right shift key is small and I often miss it.  Please note: the two feet of the hinge, which touch the table when the screen is up, can scratch a wood finish very easily.  I produced three scratches at home before I figured out what the sound was. Like one reviewer as well, my keyboard had a slight warp that made it wobble.  I've bent it back into shape.  Some parts of the construction seem needlessly cheap, like the warped keyboard and the glossy and sometimes flimsy back of the tablet.  Less like the Nexus 10 back and more like the lid to my old Asus 1201n.  You don't notice the flex until you pick up the screen in tablet mode.Overall, I continue to be impressed with the performance and functionality of the T100.  Win 8.1 is great on this machine. It is everything I wanted in Android that Google or MS won't allow - split screen, great multitasking, great MS Office experience. It has an awesome Baytrail chip with an exceptional balance between power and battery life. Rumor is, too, that once the first Android Baytrails are launched the T100 will be able to dual boot Android and Win 8.1.Update after one month of use:My concerns about the keyboard are gone.  I'm fully adjusted to the size and placement of keys and I can type as comfortably on this machine as I can on a full sized keyboard.  I did notice the reduction in size for about two weeks, then it faded from consciousness and my typing seemed normal.This is my daily driver - I have no need of any other computer or tablet with this machine.  I did load up a few indie games - particularly FEZ.  The  tablet keyboard combo seems to be ideal for this type of game.  You have about 10hrs of battery, so the only problem you will have playing relatively simple games on here is that they'll be difficult to put down.  My initial concerns about build quality diminish the more I use the device.

An \\\"Administrators\\\" account is a backdoor route viruses\/malware uses get in and cause unrecoverable distruction to your data. With Admin rights those malware can easily infect deep within your \\\"recovery partitions'! meaning, these's not turning back and you're royally screwed. Theres many more problems that can happen but I think you already get my point.GOALS: 1) Don't use your Main MS Account as an\\\" Adminitrator\\\" but instead \\\"standard\\\"  2) Create a secondary account called \\\"local account\\\" and set that up as the Administrator instead.Account Management: steps creating a local account(administrator) and MS Account(standard)Charms search: type\\\"control panel\\\" > \\\"User's Accounts and Family Safety\\\" > \\\"Remove User account\\\" > \\\" Add a new user in PC settings \\\" located at bottom of window > Bringing you to Metro > click \\\"add Account\\\" > \\\"Sign in without MS accout\\\" located at bottom of page > \\\"Local Accout\\\" > create new user name and PWYou have 2 options on Signing IN1) Microsoft account or 2) Local Account1) Create or sign in with your MAIN Microsoft Account. If you already an MS account or uses windows phones\/ xbox live or Hotmail\/live\/MSN email address you can use these as well to link those services to 1 master MS Account.2) Create a Local Account. Thise secondary account will not connect to MS's ecosytem but only in your local computer. I identical to USERS login on Windows 7,Vista,XP etc.Once you've setup these two accounts, you must set each account type to: >Change ACCOUNT TYPE for Main MS Account to \\\"Standard\\\"Change ACCOUNT TYPE for 2ndary Local Account to \\\"Administrator\\\"Please do these steps, it only takes 5minutes.  Its a small price to pay considering, it may  potentially rescue your entire data from a completely erasing your data after sending it for repairs.__________________________________________________________________________Making Back ups\/ EtcAnother tip is to make a recovery image.First install Setup all your programs , setup your custom settings, etcAfter personalizing your PC.  > Its time to Create a Recovery Image right after you've set everything up.  This image will allow you to revert back to this pc's state in time, and in perfect working order.Sometimes system recovery doesn't solve your problems so having secondary backup plan like Recovery Image is key.______________________________________________________________________________CYBERATTACKSNot optional, must practice these 3 regular computing habits.#1  (Install AVG\/free) or  Kaspersky Internet Security 2014  is the leading software in the market today at $50 or Norton.

MalwareBytes(free) is categorized as a Remover not a Preventor.#3  (Install Superantispyware\/free, Scan pc every 2wks)SuperAntiSpyware SAS; often cleans up tracking cookies.Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the the autoprotect and autoscan scheduler feature. SuperAntiSpyware is categorized as - Remover not a Preventor.#4 (Install SpywareBlaster\/Free)A popular choice  Unlike other programs. SpywareBlaster does not have to remain running in the backroound inorder to do its job.  SpywareBlaster is categorized as a Preventor not a Remover.Its ok skip a few scans between months, although not advisable, especially if your a heavy web surfing maniac spending 2-3 hrs daily websurfing.  But please dont go without using at least 1 Remover program on the list more than 2-4 Months in between scans.Furthermore i'd like to discuss the misconceptions regarding the built-in security solution in Windows 8, called Windows Defender. Windows Defender is definitely not sufficient to protect typical home users during a period of what is considered a renaissance like advancement in black technical field of  melicious software development.  If you think or belive those \\\"techsavy\\\" people, thinking windows defender is enough, you're clueless. But I also believe Windows Defender on Windows 8 is a very strong addition to Windows OS in general.________________________________________________________________________Another way to avoid  spreading your personal information out there into the wild unknowingly is to un-google yourself.yes ladies and gents! google or yahoo especially yahoo LOL..... but google is key here.Microsoft sells Primarily Software.Apple sells Primarily HardwareGoogle sells neither, that's why their products are so CHEAP, once they suckered in their backdoor ridden ecosystem, Google Inc. sells Primarily Everything about YOU!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Steps in upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1  (2-3hrs)Key here is to ensure your windows 8 is fully updated before upgrading to win8.1Therefore repeatedly \\\"check of updates\\\" on windowsHow to upgrade to windows 8.1 for dummies.Step 1: Go to Metro and not desktopStep 2: Start typing : \\\"Control Panel\\\"Step 3: Click \\\"Windows Update\\\" > \\\"Check for Update\\\"Step 4: install updatesStep 5: restart computerStep 6: Repeat step 1 -5 until result \\\"no more updates\\\"Step 7: Run HP Update client, install all updates from HP to ensure all drivers and bugfixes are updated.( or whichever OEM you may have, lenovo,dell, sony etc.)Step 8: Uninstall your Antivirus Software (important) then RESTART PCStep 9: Go to Windows Store and upgrade to 8.1Step 10: leave computer on for 2hrs as it upgrades.Step 11: Repeat Steps 1 - 7Step 12: if you're not a complete fool, 8.1 upgrade should be straight forward. \\\\After steps 1-8 ONLY THEN you should install WIndows 8.1 at the marketplace.

Even with the same built in webcam, with built in mic, and two built in speakers. Only that i15RV-954BLK is just a later revision of i15RV-953BLK. And yet so much praise for i15RV-953BLK, while little praise for i15RV-954BLK. Yet they are the same.But for what I paid for this laptop, I am very impressed. So far it functions very well. Everything seems to work very well. Even HD videos, and graphics designing apps work smoothly.Few things they left out in the specs that this laptop, which is Inspiron 15 3521, has is:*  Webcam with mic: 0.92 megapixel, 720 HD at 30 fps max*  Two built-in speakers at 2 watts each*  Ethernet LAN on motherboard (LOM) at 10\/100 Mbps (I tested and verified the 100 Mbps LAN with Cat 6 Ethernet cables, Gigabit switch and Gigabit router.)*  Wireless Mini-card at Wifi 2.4 Ghz, 802.11 b\/g\/n and Bluetooth 4.0 (on the same card)*  RAM can be expanded to 8 GB Dual\u2011channel DDR3 SODIMM modules up to 1600 MHz. Two RAM slots total.*  You can turn off SecureBoot and UEFI. And you can run Legacy BIOS*  You can run the newer Linux distros, including Ubuntu either Legacy or UEFI*  You can dual boot between Windows 8.1 and Linux either Legacy or UEFI (I tested & verified with the pre-installed Windows 8.1 & Kubuntu 13.10 dual boot with UEFI on this laptop. Works good.) (To boot Windows 8.1 in Legacy BIOS you will have to reinstall Win 8.1 within Legacy BIOS instead of UEFI.) I chose the UEFI so I didn't need to reinstall Windows 8.1 again and that UEFI is the future. So it is better learn to deal with UEFI now.*  You can get into BIOS by: At Boot splash screen press: F2: Setup (BIOS) or F12: Boot Options*  Audio Controller ALC3223The negativity that I see is the plastic parts, especially with the CD\/DVD drive drawer can break very easily. I would not want to bump something to the CD\/DVD drawer or drop this laptop. So ruggedness doesn't come in my mind when I look at this laptop. They had to cut cost somewhere.The other downside has nothing to do with the laptop, but with Amazon shipment department. The shipping box was way too large. The Amazon tape was cut and clear tape was taped over. When I got the package from the delivery person the shipping box was wide open again.I will have to update this review in a month or two. And will let you know how it went in installing Linux\/MS Windows 8.1 dual-boot. Yes, I am going to try to install Linux and dual-boot with MS Win 8.1At this time I would recommend this laptop to someone that is on a tight budget.

I think for typing a LOT, this might not be the greatest choice.  However, normal everyday work on it isn't tedious. Overall he is pretty happy with it.  I've used it for streaming and for Internet and have been pleased by the speed and display.  His complaint is that it isn't powerful enough to run his huge nerdy video games.  However, he has a desk top gaming computer for that and this was purchased for school, so I am simply happy that he is able to operate Office on it just fine.It is lightweight and easy to carry around in spite of being a little on the large side.

We've been using ours all throughout the charger 'crisis' and we are as happy with it today if not happier than we were on 'day one'. More than two months later, HP's Chromebook 11 continues to be a beautiful little device with a great display that continues to do most of what I require during my off-work hours. It traveled with me on my vacation and will travel with me again and it's there (on couch or on my bedside table) when I need it._____________________________________________________WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.ï¿‹ï¾• My Chromebook is my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.ï¿ƒï¾œï¿‚ï¾¥ Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.ï¿ƒï¾œï¿‚ï¾¥ Extremely safe OS.ï¿‹ï¾• Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.ï¿‹ï¾• Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.ï¿‹ï¾• Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates\/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.ï¿‹ï¾• The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.ï¿‹ï¾• Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.ï¿‹ï¾• Chromium being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC\/laptop\/tablet of equivalent specs.ï¿‹ï¾• Relatively low prince, 11.6\\\" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.HP's CHROMEBOOK 11I haven't spent a lot of time with HP's but, from the start, it was a very familiar feeling. HPs is not 'exactly like' Samsung's but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook.Here are some changes:ï¿‹ï¾• USB-based charging. This is a BIG thing. The biggest negative in the case of Samsung's Chromebook was the proprietary charger. HP's USB-based charging allows the use of most off-the-shelf chargers so there's a lot less to worry.ï¿‹ï¾• Better quality display. When compared to Samsung's the colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left\/right or up\/down.ï¿‹ï¾• Nicer keyboard. It's the same layout but the keys seem to have a little more travel. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both but, on a blind test, I would probably pick HP's over Samsung's.ï¿‹ï¾• Somewhat more stylish design. I got the black model and I like both the color and the color accents. Some prefer 'silver' but they are both Okay as far as I can tell.ï¿‹ï¾• Fewer ports. There are no USB 3.0 or HDMI ports on the HP's even though my understanding is that you can, in fact output HDMI through the Micro USB. This may be a big deal for some and they should get Samsung's if that's the case. Speaking for myself, I never felt a need to output HDMI off my Chromebook, ever. Same for USB data transfers.Overall, I am very pleased with HPs device. The lack of USB 3.0 and HDMI ports amount to a big 'nothing' to me and their absence is balanced and surpassed by the non-proprietary charging method, much nicer display and better keyboard.RATINGI am not going to compare HP's Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because Chromebooks and this particular one are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.HPs is a five-star to me because it's at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung. The thirty dollars price difference between the two can be justified by HP's supporting USB charging, its much nicer display and its marginally better keyboard. As far as performance, they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast (no need of an HDMI cable for that) - I mention it because I just tried that.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets._____________________________________________________CHROMEBOOK vs. CHROMEBOOK (HPs vs. Acer C720I had the opportunity to play with Acer's Chromebook for a day and was therefore able to compare them side by side.- Advantage HP -ï¿‹ï¾• Looks and design. HPs looks much better in my view, you have color choices and that's that.ï¿‹ï¾• Display. Same size, same resolution but HPs display is brighter, sharper and, most importantly, can be viewed from almost any angle. Not the case with Acer's.ï¿‹ï¾• Charging. The ability to charge HPs Chromebook through almost any USB charger is very important to me. Acer's charger is proprietary.- Advantage Acer -ï¿‹ï¾• Horsepower. Acer's appears to be faster and it should be given its faster processor.ï¿‹ï¾• Ports. You get HDMI out, USB 3.0 and SD card slot, all of them missing on HP's machine.ï¿‹ï¾• Price. At least at launch, Acer's was selling for less.I would say it's a tie when it comes to the keyboard and track pad's feel.Acer's machine has the advantage if you are more 'productivity oriented' and need expansion capabilities (ports) and more raw CPU power. You would prefer the HP if you want a Chromebook mainly for fun and casual activities where looks, the availability of a charger and, very importantly, the quality of the display count more._____________________________________________________NOTES:- Like most Chromebooks, this one too comes with a free 100GB in Google's cloud for two years. I didn't take advantage of that offer and I'm not going to go for this one, simply because I have no use of 'cloud' storage that goes beyond Gmail at this time.- While Chromebooks are immune to viruses and other forms of malware, you are as tracked and 'monetized' while on a Chromebook as you are when browsing from your laptop or tablet or phone. However, there are ways to disrupt and confuse the trackers and my two favorite extensions these days are Disconnect Search (or Disconnect.me) that makes it impossible for Google to log your search activities and DoNotTrackMe which does what the name implies. Worth trying.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"First of all, I believe that words can't express how satisfied I am with my new HP Chromebook. It is super thin and light and extremely beautiful. It is so practical that I can charge this laptop with the same charger of my smartphone and the other way around. This is the best laptop on the go.The screen is very sharp, bright and high quality. Keyboard feels great when typing, speakers sound comes from the keyboard which makes this Chromebook completely sealed. There's no holes, moving parts, or anything that makes any noise.Chrome OS has had a lot of improvements since last year. There a lot of offline apps, better notifications and a lot of awesome extensions. Free Google Drive 100Gb is still awesome.I want to acknowledge that this is not a high performance laptop and is not suitable for high demanding 3D gamers. But for the price you will be fully satisfied because obviously this Chromebook has a really affordable price and is very pretty and performs almost all the task a regular computer does(and some extras that traditional computers doesn't).One thing worth mention that this computer excels is Sound. Speakers are very rich, precise, loud and clear. Music lovers will enjoy the clarity of the music. You can really enjoy watching a movie due to the richness of the image and the quality of the sound...I love this Chromebook because it just do the job well done!Any questions please feel free to ask it in the comments below section...","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"I am an IT professional (web\/application developer), and I must say that I love this new Chromebook. I purchased a Samsung 11 inch Chromebook 4 months ago and have been using it as my primary home machine ever since. The Samsung was great, but the screen was the Achilles heel. I can say that this screen is the same approximate quality of an 11 inch MacBook Air. I can't make out an advantage between the two screens. That is awesome for this price. The design is perfect, and the speakers sound great for a small laptop.It's my opinion that tablets are great for surfing the Internet and reading, but even though you may add a keyboard they are basically useless for productivity. Multi-tasking is the downfall for those devices and it really needs to get sorted out. The Chromebook is more like a tablet in a laptop disguise, and \"multi-tasks\" well. Of course it's running one core application (Chrome), but you can use multiple windows, etc. That's very helpful when copying and pasting content, and using productivity applications. For the general public that likes to surf the net, work with documents, write e-mails, etc. this is a highly recommended machine. Work can be done on the device. I also teach college courses both online and brick and mortar, and this device has been my go-to machine for grading, interacting with students, etc. That goes to show the power of the device for the typical office user. It works for advanced users like me if you take it for what it is... A damn quality piece of hardware for the price that offers a far more robust productivity experience than any competitively priced tablet.If your curious, my usage pattern for technology has now evolved to: Smartphone, Small tablet, Chromebook. No need for a large tablet.If you're on the fence, I say give it a shot.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5

Many notebook PC's can only go up to 8 Gb maximum.3.  Three USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port. The USB 3.0 port is useful for connecting to external hard drives that support USB 3.0 Super Speed data transfer. USB 3.0 is about 3.5 times faster than USB 2.0 in real world data transfer speed. The USB 2.0 port is an always-on variety, so that it can conveniently provide charging power to your other electronic gadgets like smartphone and tablet without having the computer to be turned on. The USB 3.0 ports are backward compatible, so USB 2.0 and 1.1 devices can also be plugged into them. Of course, these devices won't work at USB 3.0 speed.4.

It is designed to be easy to use and very efficient. Lenovo has thought of everything. This laptop so easy to use. It has big keys that are easy to see and read. It has 4 USB ports and the memory is expandable to 16gigs.  It comes with Windows 7 Professional and the discs for Windows 8. Lenovo has a back-up system for restoring your laptop to the state it was in when you got it. The recovery discs on this laptopare in a separately partitioned area. That means that is does NOT take away from your hard drive. This laptop urges you to make recovery discs immediately. You need to do this before you start using your computer. Anyway, less than a week after I got my laptop, I installed what should have been a good program. Up until that time, I had it on all of my computers, but it attached itself to some registry keys and when I removed what I thought was adware and spyware, it caused a problem and I could NOT use my laptop.  So, less than a week after getting my laptop, I had to use the recovery discs.  If you have read a review complaining about this laptop and they are saying that they did NOT make recovery discs, then that is their fault.  That is one of the first things that Lenovo and other laptop folks urge you to do.  I was NOT able to use a restore point, but I was able to put the recovery discs in and run them. My laptop was completely restored to the way it was the day I opened it up. It runs perfectly, just like it did when I first got it. I spent an extra $50.0 to get this laptop.  On sale, this laptop was about 50.00 more than the cheap ones. Now that I have used Lenovo, I can't imagine using another brand. I researched all the brands. Lenovo ranks best in customer service and tech support, and that encouraged me.Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"THe computer works fine and was packed perfectly Computer worked upon opening package Computer was better then expected.

This one I got has 4GB of ram and 128GB harddrive. I use this laptop mainly for browsing the internet and some programming. Now that you have a little background Ill give a quick review.From the get go this laptop is MUCH faster then my previous Macbook air. When you open the lid you are ready to go that second. On the old one I would have to wait a little for it to load and if I left chrome up and clicked on it right away then I would get the loading wheel. I havent seen this do it once. That could be because of the harddrive being so much faster.When I opened the box the laptop was already charged to 91% so im trying to kill it. Well I was on it ALL NIGHT last night and now its the morning and its only at 60%. That battery life is amazing and let me honest thats what we ask for in a laptop.If you are up in the air about this laptop(no pun intended). I would say give it a go. You could even buy it from the Apple store and if you dont like it just return it.If you are replacing an older Macbook air and have one thats because the mid 2012 then I would say get it but if you have the mid 2012 I dont know if I would suggest spending the money unless you really want battery. I hope this helps anyone trying to purchase this laptop.I am not an Apple fan boy. My desktop is a custom build Window machine so I know both worlds. Please if you have any questions just comment and I will be happy to try things for you or just answer questions.I am a Computer Engineer so im use to testing things so feel free to ask.(This is my first review)","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"This might look like just a minor spec bump from last years model. However, the new MBA boasts all day battery life: 11 inch (9 hours) and 13 inch (12 hours). This is a big step up from the previous generation. This is due to a larger battery and more efficient processor. The upcoming OS X Mavericks is supposed to be even more energy efficient than Mountain Lion. The MBA is also faster due to the new processor and has a faster wifi connection. The solid state drive in this computer makes it much faster than a regular hard drive computer.This is a great computer overall. The screen is not as nice as the retina Macbook Pro, however it is not a deal breaker. The MBA is a lightweight, portable computer and the Retina screen is thicker, heavier, and more expensive. Once they manage to make a thin, lightweight Retina Display this computer might be perfect. You will probably not miss the disc drive on this computer because it is a featherweight without it and you can use an external disc drive if you have to or remotely access another computer with a disc drive.If you are debating between the 11 and 13 inch models, it depends on what you want to use it for. The extra screen space, SD card slot, and longer battery life for $100 more makes the 13 inch a worthy choice. However, some want a truly portable machine that can fit easily in a large purse or briefcase.If you are debating between this computer and an iPad with a bluetooth keyboard, consider the ease of use and functionality of the computer versus the portability and cost of an iPad. For students, it is nice to have a real keyboard and be able to easily create documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoints on an actual computer, but I see more and more students with iPads and a keyboard case getting by just fine.If you are debating between 128GB and 256GB (or custom order 512GB from Apple), consider cloud storage. Flickr now has 1 TB free photo storage with no size restrictions. Google Drive and Evernote are great for documents and you can always store your iTunes library on an external hard drive if you have a massive library.If you are debating between this and a Windows Ultrabook\/ Google Chromebook, consider the operating system, reliability, customer service, and resale value. People love Apple products and you can resell the computer if you want to eventually upgrade. They hold their value pretty well. The operating system takes a little getting used to but it is a lot smoother than Windows and you will probably never want to switch back to the dark side. If you really need a Windows Program, you can run Windows on a Mac.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"Working off formerly a 13\" macbook air mid 2011, I just bought this new 2013 model with the Haswell CPU and low power consumption infrastructure.Off a full charge, I disconnected 3 hours 40 mins and had an external drive connected the entire time, restarted 4 times, and did NONSTOP heavy application installs (Office suite, Photoshop etc.), a total of 23 applications, and ran youtube vids in the background the entire time, and after all of that nonstop heavy loading, I had 76% on my battery, of which id have around 35% on my older Macbook Air.Further still, the entire unit has run UTTERLY COOL during this EXTREMELY heavy loading, installing and heavy 1080P video graphics play. My other Macbook Air would be almost too hot to touch underneath near back under same conditions.Even without 802ac (new Wifi connection thru the new Air), I notice roughly 25% faster throughput on likewise file downloads using my new Macbook Air than that of my older version Macbook Air.This new Macbook Air contains PCIe-Based Flash Storage Approaches 800 MB\/s Read and Write. I notice BLAZING fast write speed on my 1.1 Gig Photoshop app, and seemed about 40% faster than my previous generation Macbook Air. Also, this new Air model contains PCIe-based SSD modules made by Samsung and is smaller than the previous Air model SSD made by Toshiba.These new Airs also sport batteries with increased capacity driven by higher voltages: increasing from a 7.3 V, 6700 mAh power battery to a 7.6 V 7150 mAh power battery. Other changes include a redesigned expanded heat sink covering both the CPU and GPU, which must be why this unit runs SO COOL even maxed out.ALL my apps run perfect on this new Air, including Office suite, and the entire Adobe suite and the rest of my apps, ....which it should, its still running Mountain Lion OS.I really have to say again, that write speeds on HUGE app instals is just faster than you dare hope for; its just blazing faster than my previous gen. Air.My Macbook Air has been without a question my most treasured gem of \\\"go-to\\\" Mac product hands down, I own all of them (2 Airs, Macbook Pro, MacMini etc),...I was skeptical when I shelled out $1099 today for the new Haswell Air and its presumed prognosticated \\\"crazy long\\\" battery life and improved speeds overall; but the hype isn't hype, its real and amazing. The mere NOTION that I can overload this Air with App installs, and have a 2.5\\\" HD attached for nearly 4 hours, run 1080P Youtube vids,...and still be at 76% Batt life is just, well, its stunning.Tested out the NEW dual (stereo) mic and it IS much nicer in record, additionally the camera\/vid is much sharper and  crisper than my other Mac Air.  Considering the price point is lower on these new Airs than the older ones,  I give the new Macbook Airs a \\\"110%\\\". Having repaired laptops (non mac) in the past, and owned at least 20X more laptops than most consumers, I don't lightly conclude this is the cornerstone workhorse for everything I dare consider doing, fast got faster, and battery life now is enough to make a crusty \\\"hates everything\\\" person like myself nearly cry with joy. Congrats Apple! Homerun on this lovely gem.I didnt get this delivered in one day, I picked it up from my local Mac store, I got my buddy to sell it to me 1 day before they officially \\\"have\\\" them which is today 6\/12. As for the questions about using this new Air with Photoshop and it lagging on heavy filtering and photo editing, Ive tested that fully and this IS the machine you want for ultimate portability, it works fantastic.Also of great importance is that this version of Mac Air is supposed to have \\\"nearly double\\\" fast write speeds as the Macbook Pro Retina. And the new Hard storage on this Air has \\\"up to 6X faster than a 5400RPM disk drive\\\" as found in current Macbook Pro which contain 5400RPM Toshiba Hard drives (made by Hitachi for Toshiba actually). In short, YES, this is a perfect \\\"must own\\\" book in the field or travel use for photoshop work, with just blazing fast write speeds, and crazy long battery life.This new Macbook Air brings TRUE definition to being \\\"disconnected\\\" and \\\"portable\\\" to those who want to do a LOT of work free of the power socket! Genuine portable is finally here, ...no more staring at the battery % to rush to shut down!\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"}],"detailed_specifications":[{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Technical Details","specifications":[{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Size","description":"13.3 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Resolution","description":"1440 x 900"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor","description":"1.3 GHz Intel Core i5"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"RAM","description":"4 GB DDR3-SDRAM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Memory Speed","description":"1600 MHz"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive","description":"128 GB"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Graphics Coprocessor","description":"Intel HD Graphics 5000"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Wireless Type","description":"802.11A, 802.11B, 802.11G, 802.11n"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Brand Name","description":"Apple"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Series","description":"MD760LL\/A"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item model number","description":"MD760LL\/A"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hardware Platform","description":"Mac"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Operating System","description":"OS X Mavericks"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Weight","description":"3 pounds"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Color","description":"Silver"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Brand","description":"Intel"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Count","description":"1"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Computer Memory Type","description":"SDRAM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Flash Memory Size","description":"128"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive Interface","description":"Solid State"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Optical Drive Type","description":"No"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Battery Type","description":"Lithium Polymer (LiPo)"}]},{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Additional Information","specifications":[{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"ASIN","description":"B00746YPQI"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Customer Reviews","description":"4.4 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Best Sellers Rank","description":"#75 in Computers & Accessories (See top 100)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    #7 \n    inï¿‚ï¾ Computers & Accessories > Notebooks"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Shipping Weight","description":"6.4 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Shipping","description":"Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S."},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Date First Available","description":"June 10, 2013"}]},{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Warranty & Support"},{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Feedback"},{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"department":{"mm_name":"department","location":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/computer-pc-hardware-accessories-add-ons\/b\/ref=topnav_storetab_pc?ie=UTF8&node=541966","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Computers"},"people_also_buy":[{"mm_name":"amazon_product","location":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Apple-MacBook-MD101LL-13-3-Inch-VERSION\/dp\/B0074703CM","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","price":"$1,184.99","title":"Apple MacBook Pro MD101LL\/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)"},{"mm_name":"amazon_product","location":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Frozen-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-Digital-Copy\/dp\/B00G5G7K7O","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","price":"$19.99","title":"Frozen (Two-Disc Blu-ray \/ DVD + Digital Copy)"},{"mm_name":"amazon_product","location":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kuzy-13-inch-Rubberized-MacBook-Models\/dp\/B0077EVNY4","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","price":"$24.99","title":"Kuzy -

C720 2GB).  All of the Chromebooks have performed flawlessly so far, and the regular updates to the Chrome OS has only made them better.  This Toshiba is my fifth Chromebook and probably not my last.  I've not had any experience with the HP 14, other than looking at it in the store, and I have never seen a Pixel.  With the thousands of reviews for all the different Chromebook models here on Amazon I'm not going to get into the details of what Chromebooks can and cannot do.  Rather, I would like to focus on how this model stacks up against the other current Chromebook offerings and how it performs with my various peripherals.  If you have any question on this Toshiba, Chrome OS, any of the other Chromebook models, or the peripherals I refer to, please feel free to ask.  There is a surprising lack of detailed reviews for this machine on the web, so while my review may be long, I wanted to give people as much information as possible.PACKAGING AND UNBOXING:  This may seem like a silly category, but while the Samsung and the HP 11 had excellent packaging, the packaging for the Acers was a bit weak (poorly placed in a thin cloth-like bag and suspended by two lousy paper egg crates on the ends).  The Toshiba was nicely packaged.  There was a cloth-like bag over the lid which separated the screen from the keyboard, and the whole thing was in a nicely sealed plastic bag.  The machine was suspended in the box by 2 plastic spongy foam chunks that fit snugly over the ends.  As soon as I flipped the lid up to remove the protective cover the Chromebook started right up.OVERALL FIT AND FINISH:  For a $280 computer I am more than satisfied with the fit and finish of this Chromebook.  The exterior and interior are by far the most fingerprint free, really showing no signs of normal day to day handling.  Contrast that to the HP 11 which seems to get fingerprinted up the worst.  There is very little flex in the body when you lift the Toshiba by the front corner.  I would rate the HP 11 first in rigidity followed by the Acer C720, this Toshiba, and lastly the Samsung.  Just remember to never lift ANY laptop by the screen\/lid.  All of the seam edges feel really good on this Chromebook as well.  The Acers are probably the worst in this area while the HP 11 is the best, and the Toshiba and Samsung fall comfortably in the middle.  Time will tell how durable the finish is, but this usually isn't an issue for me because I really baby my tech.  Overall, this is a nicely put together computer.  The bottom\/back has vent and exhaust slots for the fan to circulate air, but it's not as open as the Acers.  The Samsung and HP 11 have no visible vent slots.  The HP 11 also has no visible screws holding the case together, though they are there under the colored plastic pieces on the bottom.  The Toshiba also uses nice speaker grilles instead of just slots in the bottom.  The HP 11 and Samsung can get pretty warm when you're pushing them, while the Acer and Toshiba run much cooler thanks to the fan(as long as you don't obstruct the vents).  And before I wrap up this section I would also like to recommend the Amazonbasics 13.3\\\" laptop sleeve.  It's well made and fits the Toshiba perfectly.  It won't save it from a high fall, but it will protect the computer from scratches and the elements when you transport it.SCREEN:  I have tolerated the screen on my Acer C720, but I have never been completely happy with it.  When I fired up the Toshiba I was immediately impressed with the screen.  The tone was warm and reminded me of the screen on the Samsung, but with richer colors.  The default background image showed really nice reds, yellows, and oranges; colors which don't always look so good on the Acers. The brightness is good, and right on par with all of our Chromebooks.  The screen doesn't have the quality or the viewing angles of the HP 11, but again, it isn't nearly as cool in tone as the Acers.  When you actually look at them side by side with a field of white on the screen, the Acer looks really blue.  Having the same resolution in this larger panel (when compared to the 11.6\\\" models) doesn't really seem to be an issue at all.  I don't feel like I'm looking through a screen door or anything as some people would have you believe is the case.  I'm generally not a fan of glossy panels, but it really works in this case.  I would rate the screen a respectable second to the HP 11 and I am quite pleased with it (both in image and size) so far.  Using the single color backgrounds I did a sort of quasi pixel test and found no problems.  The only bad pixel we have on any of the Chromebooks is on my C720 and it isn't really a black spot or a stuck color as much as just the look of a tiny smudge on the screen (and I never really notice it in normal use).  All of the LCD panels I have ever owned look better after being \\\"burned in\\\" so I would imagine the Toshiba panel should get a little better as I use it.  The lid\/housing itself is solid enough (not as flimsy as the HP 11 feels) but I would recommend, as with any laptop, that you manipulate it from the center or simultaneously from both corners.KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD:  The keyboard definitely has a different feel to it when compared to the other Chromebooks.  The HP 11 has the best keyboard of the bunch by a wide margin.  The Samsung takes second, followed by the Acers and this Toshiba, however, it wouldn't surprise me if the Toshiba knocked the Acer down a peg as I get used to it.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the keyboard is a (tiny) bit stiff.  I would imagine that I'll adjust to it (which I am even as I type this review), but it just doesn't seem to have the snap of the other machines.  The Toshiba keyboard is nice and quiet, however, if that is a consideration for you (especially compared to the Acers, which can be quite noisy).  I like the texture of the Toshiba's touchpad and it has been responding well for me.  It has a visible pattern on it that offers just the right amount of resistance under your fingers.  It has a similar feel to the HP 11, but isn't as sensitive.  The HP 11 is the most sensitive touchpad of all the Chromebooks and it works better for me when it's set to one click below the maximum speed.  I would rate the touchpad of the Toshiba as my favorite.  I definitely like it better than the pad on the Acer that I use daily due to the surface texture and the larger size.  Don't be too quick to judge any Chromebook's touchpad performance.  Especially if you are coming from a different Chromebook or if you have a lot of Chrome apps.  When my Toshiba was synchronizing to my Google account  it was having an affect on the movement of the cursor (remember my 7 pages of apps).  This was in no way the fault of the pad, but rather a result of all the apps being downloaded and installed.  Once the sync was complete everything smoothed up.PERFORMANCE:  I've done everything with this Chromebook that I've done with all of our Chromebooks and it is seems just as quick as my 4GB C720.  To be honest, I never really noticed a difference in performance between the 2GB and 4GB Acers in day to day use, so I wasn't surprised with how well this machine runs.  From being shut down to displaying the logon screen takes the Haswells maybe 5 seconds max, and from sleep to logon is about as fast as you can open the lid.  Web pages load quickly and scroll very smoothly.  Using the example of Facebook, on the Haswells the page loads quickly and the scrolling smooths out quickly as well, the HP 11 and Samsung take longer to load and the page doesn't scroll as smoothly.  The Haswell machines are excellent performers when compared to the ARM machines like the Samsung and HP 11 which get the job done, but are definitely in need of a performance upgrade (which I believe is right around the corner).  You should notice improvement as pages you visit are cached, and performance may also improve as the system gets broken in.  I added a 128GB SSD to my C720 4GB which works great, and I'm hoping to do the same with this Toshiba.  I just want to wait until I can find more information about the internals.  If it uses the same type SSD drive as the Acers it would be a worthy and likely simple upgrade (though it would void my warranty).PORTS:  Both USB 3 ports seem to be functioning just fine, although they fit a bit tighter than the ports on the other Chromebooks.  I tested them with my Logitech mouse, a 32GB flash drive, and several portable HDDs (as well as a few other devices I'll mention later).  Connecting my Android phone charged it, but I couldn't browse it or transfer any files.  The biggest surprise came when I went to plug in an SD card; it went in ALL THE WAY!  For the Chromebooks with an SD card slot it is nice to be able to add a large amount of local storage for a small amount of money.  The biggest problem was that the slot on the Samsung and the Acer (no slot on HP 11) do not allow the card to seat fully into the machine.  And having to dismount and remove your card every time you wanted to case your computer can be a real annoyance.  The SD card slot is also spring loaded.  Thank you Toshiba for this simple pleasure.  I will never understand why I can get an SD card all the way into my tiny digital camera, but not into my 17\\\" HP laptop or any of my other Chromebooks.  I also connected the Toshiba to my TV via HDMI and it worked as well as my C720.SPEAKERS, HEADPHONE\/MIC JACK AND WEBCAM:  As other reviewers have mentioned issues with the sound I have been running a constant stream of music off of Google Play Music or playing sound from videos for the entire time I have been using this computer.  I am happy to report that I have not had any issues as of yet.  I have never had sound issues with any of our Chromebooks that I can report either.  The speakers are located on the bottom in the front and they can play pretty loud.  The HP 11 speakers may edge out the other Chromebooks simply because they fire up through the keyboard, but I am always using my computer on a table or lap desk (and with headphones or earbuds more often than not) so muffled sound isn't an issue for me.  The sound through the headphone jack is really good as well.  I have never used a headset\/mic with any of the Chromebooks so I really couldn't comment on how well that works.  I used the webcam to make a Hangouts call to my brother and it worked.  If you do a lot of video calls on Hangouts or you like to play with a webcam I would suggest getting a better one.  According to the help files, Chrome OS can support USB webcams (just not the software they come with).  I would suggest some research before purchasing a webcam to see if it's compatible.PRINTING:  Because I have had my other Chromebooks connected to my Canon cloud printer I was able to print without doing any additional setup.  If you don't have a cloud ready printer it is still really easy to connect a Chromebook to a printer using a the Chrome web browser and a PC or Mac as as a host.  It took me all of 5 minutes to set mine up that way with my old printer.  With the cost of ink, I tend to print a lot less now days.  I actually prefer to \\\"print\\\" things as a PDF file.  I have 115 gigs of storage on my cloud drive so I may as well use it.CHARGING AND BATTERY LIFE:  I mentioned the Toshiba charger in an earlier section, but I also wanted to elaborate on the differences in how the Chromebooks charge and how they drain.  Like I said earlier, the cords and brick for this Toshiba add up to a total length of 12 feet!  That's nice if you don't travel a lot with your Chromebook, but it's a problem if you have to carry that mess around with you.  On the positive side, the charger includes a velcro strap that has more than enough length to wrap the cords into a manageable bundle.  The cords on the Acer add up to 9 feet.  The micro USB charger that comes with the HP 11 is the shortest (6 feet) and most compact of the bunch (the transformer is only 1.5 x 1.5 x 1), but it is a lot easier to carry around.  Still, the convenience that everyone talks about in being able to charge your Chromebook with the ever so common micro USB chargers we all have is grossly overrated.  The HP 11 takes far longer to fully charge than any of our other Chromebooks (around 3 to 4 hours give or take), and it seems to drain the fastest as well.  If you try to charge it with a typical phone charger it will take around 8 hours to complete a full charge.  The real icing on the cake though, is that unless you are charging it with the Google charger it will not charge while you are using it.  It won't drain as slow, but it will not charge.  All of the other Chromebooks we have with their big old bricks fully charge in around 2 hours (I just charged the Toshiba from 3% to full in 1:40).  I generally run the Chromebooks at about 70 percent brightness; sometimes lower if the room is darker.  With that in mind, I have found the HP 11 to have the shortest battery life (probably due to the display looking so good when you turn it up).  The second shortest time on battery would be the Samsung.  As far as I can tell, the Acers and the Toshiba seem to have pretty much the same battery life, with a possible edge going to the Toshiba.  If you want a machine that will run all day I would recommend the Acers or the Toshiba.  I am not going to state time in hours because there are just too many variables which influence battery life.  My ratings are based on using the Chromebooks the way I use them, and observing the typical battery life.  If you really want to hypermile the battery on a Chromebook you need to turn down the brightness and ditch the streaming.  I have gotten over 10 hours off of Toshiba when I dimmed the display and didn't stream video.WIFI, BLUETOOTH, AND CHROMECAST:  The wifi on all our Chromebooks works really well.  We dumped cable a few years ago, so we rely on over-the-air television, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, and other websites\/streaming services for our entertainment and they all work well on all the Chromebooks (though they work better and faster on the Toshiba and the Acers).  I have a 50 meg internet profile with Time Warner because 30 just wasn't enough.  The only machine I have issue with on rare occasions is my C720 (it will drop and start searching for connection).  I have used the Chromebooks on public wifi as well, and have never failed to connect.  The Toshiba bluetooth works good with my Bose Soundlink Mini, and my son uses his Samsung Bluetooth with a Jawbone Mini Jambox.  The only other bluetooth device I used was an old mouse.  It worked good, but I picked up a Logitech mouse to replace it.  Because we don't have cable, I sometimes cast (to a Google Chromecast) CBS shows that I've missed.  Casting a browser window works okay, but you need a strong wifi connection.  Tab casting is still in beta and can be hit or miss.  I have had better luck casting apps that the Chromecast supports because most of those apps will go online and fetch the content you select. This is the case with Netflix, Hulu Plus, and YouTube as far as I can tell.  Mostly though, I cast music from Google Play Music to my home theater system.  Even that works better with my Android phone than it does with the Chromebook.  The Chromecast device and casting to it have gotten better since it was put on the market, but it still has a ways to go in my opinion.  The best option to get content from the Toshiba, Acers, or Samsung to your television is via HDMI.  You can connect the HP 11 with an HDMI cable but you will also need a SlimPort adapter, and those adapters plug into the Micro USB charge slot, so you can't charge while you're connected.PERIPHERALS:  All of the peripheral devices I discuss in this section have been used on all of our Chromebooks and I have tested them all on the new Toshiba (they all work quite well on it).  If you have the need or the desire to run your Chromebook with a wired ethernet connection you need only purchase a USB ethernet adapter.  I have a $15 Plugable brand USB 2 ethernet adapter that I've used on occasion(wifi issues with ATT 2Wire modem).  It plugs right in and has worked well for me (and it's a lot bigger than the pictures on Amazon would lead you to believe).  I have a couple older WD Passport HDDs and a 2TB WD Elements HDD that I connect from time to time and they all work fine (though I would like to see improvements to the Chrome OS file browser).  I've used all sorts of SD cards, USB drives, and even a USB card reader too.  If you have a newer digital camera (I have a Canon 330 Elph and a Nikon P7100) you can connect it to the Chromebook to download your photos using the Google Plus photos app.  It can be set to start automatically when it detects the camera and you can have it put your photos in the cloud.  I should also note that when I take pictures with my Android phone the photos are automatically put in the cloud and will show up on the Chromebook like a minute after you take them.  I think if you have an iPhone you can achieve the same results by installing the Google photo app or the google drive app(I am totally off Apple so I can't say for sure).  If your camera is not recognized you can always use the SD card slot or a USB card reader for other types of cards.  The peripherals I use the most, thought, with the Chromebooks are my DACs (Digital to Analog Converters).  Chromebooks, along with Google Play Music or any of the music services (Spotify, Pandora, iHeart, etc.) work great for streaming music.  However, if  you want to power some quality headphones or even some good earbuds and improve the sound of your music, you need a better DAC than what's onboard.  I have two NuForce DACs that I use with the Chromebooks.  Both units connect to a USB port, take the digital audio stream, convert it to analog, and amplify the sound.  The first one is a Nuforce Icon uDAC 3.  It's a more portable unit that uses the USB power operate.  It works good with quality earbuds and efficient headphones.  All you have to do is plug it into a USB port on the Chromebook and it is automatically selected as the default audio device.  The second DAC is a Nuforce Icon DAC.  This one is a larger unit that needs to be plugged in, but is has even better sound than the little uDAC and a lot more power.  You can also use the DACs as a pre-amplifier when connecting to a receiver or a set of powered desktop speakers.  I use mine with my Logitech Z2300 2.1 speaker system and the sound is phenomenal.So that's my review.  If you made it this far, I thank you.  And, I hope I've helped you in your research.  If you're really anti-Chromebook, just remember that the more these devices are purchased and used by consumers, the better your Windows or Apple OS machines should get.  I will be sure to update this review if something happens to come up with the Toshiba; good or bad.  And again, if you have any questions or comments please post them as I would be happy to chat.UPDATE 2-20-2014:  The Toshiba has won me over big-time, and my son is loving his hand-me-down Acer C720.  I was a bit disappointed this week when I learned that the SSD was soldered onto the motherboard, rendering it pretty much non-replaceable.  I can also confirm that while the motherboard does have 2 available \\\"slots\\\" for adding memory, it would also have to be soldered in.  Still, I did receive my Transcend 64GB SDXC memory card and it really works great.  No problems playing back 1080p video files from the card and I can leave it in the slot since it doesn't stick out like it would have done in my Acer.  Since I started using the Toshiba I have never said to myself, \\\"boy, I wish this or that was as good as my Acer\\\", so any worries about any aspect of the performance are gone.  I really appreciate the extra real estate the screen provides, and the picture seems to be settling in nicely now that it has a lot more hours on it.  I have now adjusted to the keyboard, and I would rank it a solid second to the HP 11.  When I went back and tried the keyboard on the Acer it felt rather cramped to me, which is funny because when I first got the Toshiba it felt really big.  So hey, don't judge the keyboard until you give it a bit of time.  The battery life is awesome, and it charges in under 2 hours.  Luckily, I haven't had any sound issues like a couple reviewers have reported, and I'm glad because I like the Toshiba's sound quality.  The high frequencies are much more present than in the Acer, and even though the speakers point to the bottom, the sound feels like its radiating up through the keyboard like the HP 11.  I have also been happy with how well the Bluetooth works with my Soundlink Mini.  The webcam is pretty bad in all but the best light, so I've ordered a Logitech C525 webcam to see how it works.  I will update when I test the webcam in case anyone is interested.WEBCAM UPDATE 2-21-2014:  So, I got the Logitech C525 webcam today and I ran it on the Toshiba.  The quality of the picture is GREATLY IMPROVED over the built-in unit.  With the Webcam Toy app I had to choose the new camera in the Flash Player app that asks you to authorize the camera when you first launch it.  With hangouts, I had to go into the settings and choose the Logitech as the default device. It was easy to find.  If you do a lot of video calling or recording I would highly recommend a small investment in a better webcam.  It's also nice because you can point it around the room without having to move the computer.  If anyone can recommend a good recording app in the Chrome Web Store I would appreciate that as well.CHROME OS UPDATE: With the latest version of Chrome OS being installed on my Chromebooks (version 33), I notice that when I connect my Android phone the Google+ Photo app will launch and ask me if I would like to upload my pictures.  For me, this is redundant as every picture I take with my phone is backed up into my Cloud already, but for some this would be a nice added feature of Chrome OS.  However, I am still not able to browse the files and do transfers between my phone and the Chromebook.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"I purchased a MacBook Pro a few months ago and love the laptop computer.  I've been an Apple customer since the inception of Macintosh, owning only one PC in my lifetime. I have never purchased an iPad.  The Toshiba Chromebook CB35-A3120 PLM01U-002005 13.3-Inch Cloud Computer is Toshiba's first entry into the Chromebook market, my first Chromebook and it did not disappoint this consumer.It is about the same dimensions as my MacBook Pro, but thinner and substantially lighter in weight.  With a solid state, no hard drive or DVD in this one, it is the one I'll take when traveling.  Out of the box, I plugged in the Chromebook, then opened the lid.  Immediately, the registration process began and since I'm already a Google customer, it was quick and simple.  Setup was faster than fast and within a couple of minutes I was on the web, with access to all my Google contents, even those from my Android.  Another few minutes and I was set up to print from my Epson printer which is in another room.  Whereas I need to use an Epson app to print from the Android, this prints from the Google Cloud.  The Google store offers a lot of apps, many of which are free, and a few which I found desirable and downloaded.  With two USB ports, I'm able to carry a USB with me instead of relying on the cloud for everything.  With the HDMI, I can hook up to a larger screen if I want.  Chromebooks are designed for streaming and internet based operations, and there is no software to install.  It's all out there for you to use without taking up space or requiring moving parts in your computer.The appearance of this Chromebook is very sleek, with an attractive texture to the cover that feels good in the hand.  For me, it's an easier, less slippery grip than others I've held onto.  Start up is nearly instantaneous with the Chromebook as soon as the lid is lifted up -- I turn it off each time I'm done with it.  The battery time is longer than I'd expected, fortunately because although the charge time is fast, the power supply I have gets uncomfortably hot.  Because of this, I do not keep it plugged in while charging.  My second criticism of this unit is that it makes a disturbing noise on the left side closest to me periodically while operating.  At first, I thought the sound was coming from the power supply, but determined it is from the Chromebook after disconnecting the power supply.  It's not constant, just annoying when it occurs because it takes over my focus.  The keypad is very comfortable for me and I've not stumbled moving between my MacBook Pro and Toshiba Chromebook.  The trackpad is a little jumpy, but not as bad as it could be, even after making adjustments through the Settings.  The screen presents a terrific image and the speakers also are better than I'd expected at this price.  All in all, I can't believe they are selling this Chromebook for 279.  I can see why Chromebooks are all that in schools now.  It's nice to have an option to lock your Chromebook if you're taking it to a place where it might \\\"walk away\\\" and requiring a sign-in to access the operating system is another plus.  I like it and could love the Toshiba Chromebook in time.UPDATE a few days later:  Amazonian Consumer, another customer, provided comments on my review which I think are important.  He\/she noted things that are posted on the Toshiba website, so I'll address the components.  I have used the Bluetooth with no problem at all.  The RAM is limited to what's installed and the battery is not user-replaceable.  There is a Skype limitation because Chrome OS uses Hangouts instead, and the camera does work fine.  The SD card reader works, too, without a problem.  I also didn't mention that I like the Velcro cable wrap attached to the power cord, so I don't have to add one.  Mine power supply still gets hot, but when the charge is complete, it cools down.  Ironically, my Chromebook has stopped making the noises it was initially making.  Another observation I've made is that the trackpad seems to occasionally have a mind of its own and it sends things before I'm ready.  It's more than being overly sensitive and I'm going to need to work on correcting this.UPDATE 2\/6\/14: The audio now continuously goes in and out and the machine sound which I mentioned in my initial review is occurring again, usually when the audio goes out.  I have a call in to Toshiba but they aren't trained yet to deal with the Chromebook, so someone will be calling me back \\\"in a day or two.\\\"  I'm also still experiencing the cursor arbitrarily moving up on the page when I have stopped typing, so I have to be especially careful to assure that what I'm typing is being entered where intended.UPDATE 2\/18\/14: The audio problem is even worse and Toshiba never called me or net an email other than a survey on their customer service.  It took several of my initiated attempts in phone calls and I'm finally awaiting a box and label which will take another two days to arrive for this Chromebook to be returned to Toshiba for repair.  They offered me no option of simply sending a label and letting me return it in the original boxes.  Dealing with them has been terrible and one rep had the gall to ask if I'd rate him a 10 on a scale of 1-10 for assistance in a survey.I'm tempted to reduce my rating of four stars but will hold off until I receive my repaired lemon of a Chromebook which I still love despite its clicking sound, faulty speakers, sticky trackpad and terrible Toshiba telephone customer service.UPDATE 3\/11\/14:  Received my repaired Chromebook last night (FedEx signature required delivery was only option) and the speakers had been replaced.  What a difference!  No clicking sound, humming, anything other than the sound of lovely audio through the speakers.  The trackpad still isn't the smoothest, but more importantly, it still selects things that I have no intention of selecting.  For example, when selecting an email, one above or below opens instead of the one I select.  I've also had pages close or disappear for no apparent reason.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"}],"detailed_specifications":[{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Technical Details","specifications":[{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Size","description":"13.3 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Max Screen Resolution","description":"1366x768 pixels"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor","description":"1.4 GHz Celeron 2955U"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"RAM","description":"2 GB DDR3"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive","description":"16 GB"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Graphics Coprocessor","description":"Intel HD Graphics"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Wireless Type","description":"802.11bgn"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Number of USB 3.0 Ports","description":"2"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Brand Name","description":"Toshiba"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Series","description":"Toshiba Chromebook CB35-A3120"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item model number","description":"PLM01U-002005"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hardware Platform","description":"PC"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Operating System","description":"Chrome"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Weight","description":"3.3 pounds"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Dimensions  L x W x H","description":"8.90 x 12.90 x 0.80 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Color","description":"silver"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Brand","description":"Intel"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Count","description":"1"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Computer Memory Type","description":"DDR3 SDRAM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Flash Memory Size","description":"16"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive Interface","description":"Solid State"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Batteries:","description":"1 Lithium ion batteries required.

I'm a bit on the technical side, but primarily I use my Macbook for e-mail, web browsing, word processing, photo editing, and some video editing. I also run Windows occasionally, as a virtual machine, using VMWare Fusion (like parallels). So far, this Macbook Pro (MBP) does everything I need it to do and I haven't met a limitation yet.The good:* Battery life is amazing at 8 hours.* Display is incredible, pictures look like paintings on the screen. Using the Retina \"more space\" option, you get tons of real estate for running multiple apps. You can set up your display how you want, more space, larger text, or in between. Great options.* i7 CPU and 8GB Memory gives you desktop power.* Thin design, and very light considering the power inside.* 802.11ac - the fastest wireless available if you have a router that supports it, like this: Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station (ME918LL\/A)Display concerns:Some users have had bad experiences with the displays on this generation of macbook pro retinas - bad color representation or discoloration in small areas of the display. This should't be a problem anymore, it was only discovered among the newer units when this generation was introduced. Apple used both LG and Samsung to manufacture their Retina displays. It appears from research that the LG displays have had more problems. Again, probably not a concern any longer.Some things you should definitely know:* The memory and solid state drive are not upgradeable. Both of these components are soldered to the main board and cannot be altered.* There is no ethernet jack (RJ-45). If you want ethernet, you need to buy an adapter, like this Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter. Apple did this because the RJ-45 ethernet jacks are huge, and it was preventing them from making the MacBooks thinner.* There is no CD\/DVD drive. Apple has moved away from supporting optical drives. Like the ethernet jack, the DVD\/CD was a huge obstacle in making the frame on these systems smaller. If you want an Apple branded CD\/DVD, you will need this Apple USB Superdrive. Keep in mind these won't support blu-ray discs, so if you want that, you'll need to buy another brand that supports blu-ray.* On power management: If you want 8 hours of battery life, you need to let the OS manage all settings for you. If you start playing with the display brightness, display sleep time, etc, you won't get 8 hours.Bonuses:These systems now come with a nice bundle of Apple software for free.* OS X Mavericks is the latest release of their operating system. It is free for any supported Mac.* GarageBand, iMovie, and iPhoto, which used to be included in iLife, are now free to download and upgrade.* The iWork suite: Pages, Numbers and Keynote are now free for new macs.Remember to always check the Buyer's Guide at macrumors.com before purchasing a mac. There you will learn of any upcoming upgrades\/releases that you might want to wait on before spending the cash on a new mac.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"Purchased October 23, 2013 from apple.com. Delivered October 25.Pros: Fast. Good battery life. Light. Thin.Cons: Inconsistent display (probably doesn't matter to 90% of users). Non-upgradable hardware.Cons (sort of): No Ethernet port, CD drive, DVI out. Wi-FI\/USB DVD drive\/HDMI are your only options there.In some ways the satisfaction of any product is related to the expectations you go in with beforehand. With respect to anything in the bottom half of this computer, it satisfies or exceeds expectations.ErgonomicsI'm not a chiclet keyboard guy myself, but that's the way all laptops basically are these days. This is as good of a chiclet keyboard as any and probably better than many.The touchpad works great once you switch it back to normal scrolling instead of reverse scrolling. I also recommend enabling tap-to-click. The giant button that is the trackpad is a little stiff. No 10-key numpad. May be annoying for some. I personally prefer Windows keyboards, but I'm not sure how relevant that is, since I hope everyone is aware that Macs have different keyboard setups.SpeedFast. Everything I've done on the computer so far has been as good as instantaneous. Wi-Fi works great. I haven't felt in any situation where the higher-specced Macbook would have been noticeably better.Battery lifeAs far as I can tell, lives up to everything promised. With light use (Internet, word processing, 70% brightness), you'll get a good 7-8 hours.The problem comes with the screen. As far as I can tell, I do not have any of the ghosting problems of generations past. However, the screen is not color uniform!Update: They will not exchange it at the Apple store because I bought it online (???), so I have to wait for a replacement unit in the mail.Update 2: Got the replacement in the mail. So far as I can tell, the color issue is gone, but the viewing angle isn't quite as good. Worth the tradeoff to me.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"Let me preface my review by saying, I own this machine. I am not one to write a scathing review for an Apple product just because it's an Apple product. I have an iPhone 5, an iPad Mini with Retina Display and this laptop. You can check my other reviews and see that I say plenty of good things about Apple products and accessories.That being said, this laptop is not worth the asking price. No doubt, it boasts highest specs in the consumer laptop market at the moment. However, there are some critical flaws:1) Creaking noise: As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, this laptop is full of creaks. Whether because the chassis is so thin or because the bottom cover of the laptop is not screwed in tight enough, there is enough creaking to annoy even the least OCD person. The creaking is strictly a problem of aesthetics, but when you're plunking down an equivalent of a downpayment for a car, you should expect quality befitting the price.2) Retina-ready apps: Despite being on the market for over a year, there's still abundance of non-retina ready apps and websites that make you just want to rip your hair out. I'm working for a company that uses a JAVA Applet, and the application just looks bad every time I use it. Even Microsoft Office 2011, which supposedly is retina ready, has some elements which haven't been completely redesigned for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display.3) Performance: Even with the new Haswell processor and the IRIS integrated GPU, there are lags present in many website (Gmail scrolling...).4) Screen Brightness: One of the first things i've noticed with this laptop is that the brightness is well below most high-end laptops in the market.5) Battery Life: Which brings me to another annoyance with the MBPr: lackluster battery life. Despite the new Haswell processors sipping power, the battery life is hardly any better than the MBP 13\\\" 2011-2012 that my sister has.6) They keyboard has low travel. That is, when you press on a particular key, you kind of want that solid push\/feel. It's a feedback that tells you, yes, you did indeed press the key. Compared to MacBook Pro Classic or even the MacBook Air, the keys on the MacBook Pro Retina doesn't push down as low. I had a hard time the first few days of using this laptop, but I've gotten used to it so I suppose it's not a huge issue.-----Don't get me wrong, this is a powerful machine that rivals almost any other laptop in the market. I'm going to keep using it until its wheels fall off. I only want to warn potential buyers that there are issues with the laptop which you should know about before pressing that yellow Add to Cart button.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"2.0 out of 5

While it is not up the task of an equivalent gaming desktop it allows my 13 year old son to bring it to his friends on the weekend as well as have the power to run the tools for his education and school.  He's plays a game on the weekend called League of Legends and it links to the LED lights in the laptop to show his health level and all of his friends are in awe of that feature.I owned an Alienware 17 several years ago and was very disappointed in the quality of construction.  While the newer ones look the same, they are light years ahead in quality build.  I'm glad I gave the Alienware another shot, I'm a future buyer of there products and recommend them to my son's parents.This one did come with a 7200RPM drive and the ASUS was 5400.  I don't think gaming laptops should come with 5400RPM drives because they are so slow but I added a 256GB solid state drive to both of them.  They both can hold two drives and I highly recommend this upgrade.One last thing, this does come with Windows 7.  I upgraded it to Windows 8.1 with no problems, there are drivers for all the hardware.  I'm a professor of computer science and over the last few months I have been learning the in's and out's of Windows 8.1.

Considering the amount of money that you are paying, you expect things to work out of the box.Most of it do. The build quality is very good and it looks sturdy.However, there are some basic missing pieces that make this a paper weight [for me]1. No CD\/DVD eject button. The expectation is that you eject it within the OS. This is all fine until the OS is running. Say I have a CD inside the drive and the OS crashes [unable to boot]. How will I put my recovery CD in?2. No WiFi Toggle switch: Again the expectation is that every time I boot into Windows, I need to toggle by pressing F-2 [Each time at reboot, the WiFi gets disabled for unknown reason]. The down-side is that I cannot map the function keys to multimedia [in the bios]. The second disadvantage is that These function keys are not recognized in Ubuntu. Consequently, I cannot enable WiFi in Linux!!3. No driver support for Linux: I understand that the hardware runs Windows. However, only when I installed Ubuntu I realized that the components have been specifically chosen to not run Linux. Ethernet DOES NOT WORK in Linux. You cannot blame Ubuntu for this. Ubuntu supports a wide range of components, but Alienware goes out of its way to choose an esoteric, unsupported models just to force us to use only Windows.4. My primary purpose was not gaming. But, to make use of the GPU and learn CUDA programming. My code-base is entirely written in Linux. Its too much work to make it all work in Windows.Summary: Lesson learnt! Build Your Own BOX.

Works very well, touch screen works as advertised.  Screen display and keyboard are good.  The issue I have is that the memory is basically fixed at 2GB.  Early on I'd read that this was going to allow up to 8GB, which I assumed was user upgradeable.  This is not the case.  ASUS told me that the max is 4GB and that it can only be done at a service center.  \"On board\" memory is evidently soldered to the motherboard.In all honesty, so far, 2GB has been sufficient for the simple tasks this laptop is being used for (web browsing and occasional Office documents).","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"I'm going for a full 5 stars on this laptop, despite the limitations the product has in comparison to other laptops available on the market today. There are several apps that come pre-loaded on the laptop including Netflix, Bing search, paint, a pinball game, but it does not come with the Office Suite loaded, this will need to be a separate purchase. There are a couple of really good free word processors out there like LibreOffice that run very smoothly and have excellent features, not to mention Google Docs.The main and only real issue I have with the laptop is the inability, as another reviewer has mentioned, to upgrade the memory. It comes with 2GB and cannot be swapped out by the end user. I think being able to do so could make up for some speed issues elsewhere. 2GB isn't exactly the high end of the spectrum, but it can push what this laptop was designed for, and I'm okay to settle with that.While many users of Windows 8 had some issues with the layout and the functionality \/ familiarity of the operating system, I feel that the environment works well with this laptop. The touch screen works admirably and I have not had any issues with switching back and forth between using on screen commands and regular keyboard or mouse commands. The best way to describe the operating system is somewhere between a more traditional Windows environment and a smartphone. There is a desktop, with folders, time, and all the rest we are used to seeing, and there are also app-launcher screens that can be accessed and are laid out very similar to how the apps are arranged on a phone.There is sufficient hard drive space for movies, documents, and music, but it is on the slower end of hard drives.There are plenty of ports on the laptop, and while I've seen others mention the lack of an optical drive (that is a DVD drive, fyi) I cannot imagine anything that I'd truly need an optical drive for. This machine is not meant to push serious computer games, and most software can be downloaded from the manufacturer if you're wanting software of the laptop. If you're still wanting one, however, $30 can get you a USB powered drive and the problem is solved.The laptop is designed for everyday use, but not by superusers or those with unrealistic expectations of how a laptop should function. You will need to be patient upon set up, which takes about 5 - 10 minutes, and the laptop itself is a bit on the slower side. This however, is to be expected with the onboard hardware, and for the price and components, this is an excellent laptop if you're just needing word documents, spreadsheets, pictures, videos, music, and general web browsing.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"It took approximately 4 minutes to set up, not due to the proprietary setup but due to having to set up Windows 8.  Windows 8 comes on this laptop. Like all the windows 8 computers, it comes without having a start button in desktop mode. You can easily get one by googling, and downloading the free classic shells program.McAfee antivirus comes installed. I prefer to choose the Avast free personal antivirus program, and it recognized the tablet immediately, and downloaded quickly.Intel Celeron 1007U (1.5GHz) processor is okay.  For a Celeron processor it has good power.*Not for games. We had it freeze up on more than one occasion when trying to play simple games on PBS kids.No Bluetooth, but does have Decent WiFi connectivity.I prefer my ASUS tablets small best price and great functions ASUS MeMOPad HD 7-Inch 16 GB Tablet, Blue (ME173X-A1-BL) orASUS MeMO Pad FHD 10 ME302C-A1-BL 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet (Blue)LED with Touch screen is reasonably responsive not as good as my I-pad, but it is better than other laptop touch screens that I have tested in stores.  YOU CANNOT INCREASE THE SIZE OF VIEW BY TOUCH SCREENE.The keyboard is a traditional laptop Chiclet Style Keyboard setup with center scroll pad. You can use both the touch and key board interchangeably. It was sometimes quicker to use the touch screen to navigate where I needed to go.  * It does vent on the left and it gets hot, Do not block the vents.Voice command works great.It has a real good battery life.  It easily held the charge to play a two hour movie. Movie played clean and clear.  Visual screen is very good and sound works great.*One important note to purchasers: the power cable Jack must be pushed in until it clicks in to ensure charging.This laptop has an ultrabook shape and size, but is actually a little heavier than normal laptop that fit in that category.Ports included are USB 2.0 USB 3.0 Vga and HDMI.Like other small forms of notebooks of this era, it does not have an optical drive.  Although this can be overcome by attaching one by USB Drive.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars"},{"mm_name":"reviews","content":"The hot trend in terms of Windows Laptops is Windows 8 and touch screens. The Asus VivoBook X200CA is one such foray into the market, but it is one that is lacking. It is not as much a laptop than it is a touch screen enabled Windows 8 netbook - that class of small, lightweight and unfortunately underpowered machines that emphasize portability and battery life over power. While a fun experiment and a great way to get your feet wet with Windows 8 and a touch screen, the machine comes up lacking for any real regular use.As I am writing this, I am running the machine with the default McAfee security program and Open Office, and I'm currently using 75% of my memory. Part of that is that the system is downloading updates and the included McAfee is scanning it as it downloads but as someone who multi-tasks work, this is going to be a problem. The light memory (only 2 GB) and the beyond weak processor (a Pentium Celeron 1.5 Ghz) prevents this machine from living up to potential. Unfortunately, laptops need a bit more oomph, because unless you leave it on or you use it every day, when you boot the laptop, you need to compete with updates and downloads before you can get started on your work. Which is too bad because otherwise there is a lot of potential here. Sleek and lightweight, the machine weighs in a very light 2.6 lbs. with a bright 11.6 inch touch screen. It is built for portability - there is no optical drive but the machine boasts two USB 2.0 ports on one side and a USB 3.0 port on the other side. Video has both a VGA and an HDMI output on the left hand side to give options to hook up to a larger display. Networking is either the built in 801.11 bgn wireless, but also has a sleek expanding Ethernet port for wired networking if needed.The keyboard is fairly nice to type on featuring a well laid out collection of keys for the size of the keyboard, with the keys the raised Chiclet style that give nicely under the fingers for tactile typing, as well as an on-screen keyboard for touch screen use. At the bottom of the screen is a rather large trackpad that is set up for multi-touch gestures, allowing the user to navigate through programs and the Windows 8 screens with multi-finger gestures. The gestures take some getting used to but overall they can be used for a speedy response without having to move from the keyboard to the screen and back.The warranty and battery life are not bad at one year, and a reported 5 hours of life. Unfortunately, the battery seems to be inside the body which means that it is not easily replaceable, nor is it possible to get a longer lived battery.Unfortunately in the end I have a very hard time getting past the lack of memory and power. I understand that is part of the reason the price is more in line with what we were paying for netbooks, but I have a hard time recommending this machine beyond as either an entry level laptop for year or so, or as a supplemental, very portable machine for on the go. Otherwise, if you are able, up your budget $200 and look for full powered notebooks with AMD or Intel's i3 or i5 line of processors and a decent amount of memory. In the end, you truly get what you pay for.\"}\">Read more \u203A","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars"}],"detailed_specifications":[{"mm_name":"detailed_specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Technical Details","specifications":[{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Size","description":"11.6 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Screen Resolution","description":"1366 x 768"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Max Screen Resolution","description":"1366*768 pixels"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor","description":"1.5 GHz Intel Celeron 1007U"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"RAM","description":"2 GB DDR3"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Memory Speed","description":"1333 MHz"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive","description":"500 GB"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Wireless Type","description":"802.11bgn"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Number of USB 2.0 Ports","description":"2"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Number of USB 3.0 Ports","description":"1"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Brand Name","description":"Asus"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Series","description":"Asus"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item model number","description":"X200CA-DB01T"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hardware Platform","description":"Mac"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Operating System","description":"Windows 8"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Weight","description":"2.6 pounds"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Item Dimensions  L x W x H","description":"11.90 x 7.90 x 1 inches"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Color","description":"Black"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Brand","description":"Intel"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Processor Count","description":"2"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Computer Memory Type","description":"DDR3 SDRAM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive Interface","description":"Serial ATA"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Hard Drive Rotational Speed","description":"5400 RPM"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Optical Drive Type","description":"No"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Battery Type","description":"Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion)"},{"mm_name":"specifications","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Batteries:","description":"1 Nonstandard Battery batteries required.
